<h2 class="vspace">Hearings Before the President's Commission<br />

on the<br />

Assassination of President Kennedy</h2>

<h2 id="CB">TESTIMONY OF ASSISTANT CHIEF CHARLES BATCHELOR</h2>

<p>The testimony of Assistant Chief Charles Batchelor was taken at 8:30 p.m., on
March 23, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,
Bryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel
of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. My name is Burt Griffin. I am a member of the advisory staff
of the general counsel of the President's Commission. Under the provisions
of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and the rules of procedure
adopted by the Commission in conformance with the Executive order and the
joint resolution, I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you,
Chief Batchelor.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission's inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of
President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.
In particular as to you, Chief Batchelor, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the security surrounding the protection
of Lee Harvey Oswald and any other pertinent facts that you may know about
the general inquiry having to do with the death of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Chief Batchelor, you have appeared here today by virtue of a general request
made by the general counsel of the staff of the President's Commission.
Under the rules adopted by the Commission, you are entitled to a 3-day written
notice prior to the taking of this deposition. But the rules adopted by the
Commission also provide that any witness may waive this notice. Do you
now waive this notice?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you raise your right hand and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you state your name for the record?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Charles Batchelor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your age?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Fifty-eight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live, Mr. Batchelor?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. 1022 Franklin Avenue, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I am assistant chief of police of the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Since May 1, 1936.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been assistant chief?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Since January 20, 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of course you and I have spoken at some length earlier this
afternoon. In that conversation, we discussed your activities from the time
that you learned that President Kennedy was shot on November 22 until Saturday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
November 23, when you first heard something about the movement of
Lee Harvey Oswald from the Dallas City Jail to the Dallas County Jail. I
believe you told me that sometime on Saturday night you were confronted by
some newspaper reporters with respect to the movement of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you tell us, Chief Batchelor, about what time of the
night these reporters approached you?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. This must have been somewhere around 7:30 or 8 o'clock
at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I was in the administrative offices of the police department
at headquarters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is on the third floor? On the third floor of the police
<span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you inside your own office?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; I was out in the outer office of the administrative
offices where the secretaries are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall how many reporters confronted you?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. There were two of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who they were?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; I don't recall who they were now. It was a rather
casual request. They asked, or they said, rather, that they were hungry and
hadn't had anything to eat and they wanted to go out to dinner, and they
didn't want to miss anything if we were going to move the prisoner. And I
told them I had no idea when they were going to move the prisoner.</p>

<p>About that time Chief Curry came up and he told them, he said, "Oh, I
think if you fellows are back here by 10 o'clock in the morning you won't
miss anything."</p>

<p>So they left with that and went to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any other reporters around at that time?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir. Then later, just a very few minutes later, Chief
Curry decided, well, he might tell the rest of the people out in the hall so they
won't be hanging around, because they were apparently doing nothing, just
waiting. So he went out and told them that if they would come back by 10
o'clock in the morning, they were not going to move the prisoner in the
meantime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with Chief Curry after he first spoke to these two
newspaper reporters?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. You mean with reference to the movement of the prisoner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. He told me that he didn't know exactly when they would
move him, but he thought homicide bureau was about through with questioning
him, but he knew that Captain Fritz wanted to question him again in the
morning, and that after he had questioned him, why, we would move him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did that conversation take place?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. In the administrative offices. One thing I think I omitted.
From the time that he told these reporters that if they were to come back by
10 o'clock in the morning, he didn't think they would miss anything, he went
in and discussed it with Captain Fritz as to how he was progressing with the
interrogation and whether or not he thought he would be through with him in
the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mean this was between the time <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Before he went out and announced it to the rest of the
press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how much time elapsed, would you say, from the time
he talked to the two reporters and the time he made the general announcement?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Oh, I would estimate maybe 30 minutes; no longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, in between times, did he talk with you about the
movement?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Afterwards, did he talk with you about the proposed movement?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. You mean the mechanics of moving him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anything?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the next thing you learned about the proposed movement
of Oswald?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I just assumed that we would move him the next morning
sometime after 10 o'clock. I didn't know exactly when, and I came down
the next morning around 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you learn anything about the movement between the time
Chief Curry made the general announcement to the press and the time that you
went home that night?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any conversation around the building?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anybody else present from the police department
when you talked with the two newspaper reporters?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. There were some secretaries in the office. This was not
addressed to me particularly. They might have overheard it. We were in the
office, in the outer office nearest Chief Curry's office at this time, and I believe
Mrs. Ann Schreiber was holding down that desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time did you leave the police department on Saturday
night or Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. It was, I believe, on Saturday night, or Sunday morning.
It was around midnight. It wasn't quite as late as it was the night before when
I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So would it be your estimate that about 4 hours elapsed between
the chief's press conference and the time you left?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I would say maybe not quite that long, but that is not too
far off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Chief, maybe this will help you a little bit to refresh your
recollection.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I want to take that back. It was earlier than that when
I left there on Saturday night. It was quite late on Friday night, but it was
around 9:30 when I left Saturday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you referring to this, correcting this estimate? Are you
referring to this report dated November 23d?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I think the times in this are fairly accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Chief, I want to hand you what has already been marked for
identification as Stevenson Exhibit 5053. Can you identify that?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes. This was a report signed by myself, Chief Lumpkin,
and Chief Stevenson which was the result of a staff résumé made within a few
days after Oswald was shot.</p>

<p>It was for the purpose of bringing together the facts and times and elements
of events in a chronological order as we all remembered them. Some of the
times, particularly with reference to the President's arrival, which had to do
with meeting with some Secret Service people and other groups, and some of
this we were a little bit hazy on at first and we went back and checked some
facts.</p>

<p>As an example, we checked the Baker Hotel schedule on a room that was
reserved for a meeting that was held, so we could be sure what time this
meeting was, and things of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. The members of the police department held a meeting
at the Baker Hotel sometime over the weekend?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No. The hostess committee of the city which was hosting
the President's arrival and arranging for the luncheon, it was kind of a planning
committee, and we were asked, or I was asked to one of these meetings with
some of the Secret Service people.</p>

<p>So this was a reference point for some of our thinking when this happened
that we could relate some other things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now your report indicates that you left Saturday night at
9:30 p.m. Between the time that Chief Curry made his announcement to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
press and you left at 9:30 p.m., were you confronted by any other newspaper
people about the movement of Oswald?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir. As a matter of fact, we left not too long after
this because after this announcement was made, the press began to leave themselves.
The third floor became fairly quiet and there wasn't anybody up there
to speak of and it just died out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you confronted by anybody after the chief made his
announcement with respect to Oswald?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir; not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall how you arrived at the time at 9:30, stated in
the report? Was that based on your records?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. That was fresh in my mind when we wrote this report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, who was left in charge of the police department that
night after you left at 9:30?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. We have a night chief who comes on at 5 o'clock in the
afternoon and he works until 2 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who it was that night?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Well, there is only one. It would have been Chief Jack
Tanner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who would then replace him at 2 o'clock in the morning?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No one. There is a, well, I say no one. There is an
inspector also who works around the clock. I don't recall which inspector was
on duty that night, but there is an inspector on duty at night around the
clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I notice&mdash;if you want to refer to your report on page 29, the
report indicates that you received a telephone call at your home about 6:30 in
the morning from Captain Talbert. Can you tell us what that call was about?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes, sir. He called and informed me that he had gotten
a call, and he didn't tell me at the time where he got it; he said an anonymous
call.</p>

<p>Later I learned it came from the FBI, and they in turn had called him.
That about a hundred men were going to take the prisoner Oswald and they
didn't want to get any policeman hurt. So I told him to send a squad by
Chief Curry's house and inform him about it. And at that moment we weren't
concerned about him in the jail. We were concerned about him in the transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did Talbert call you rather than some other member of
the police department?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. He tried to call Chief Curry and he couldn't get him to
answer his phone. I guess he was dog-tired and he couldn't get him up. And
I told him to send a squad car by and tell him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Did you have any discussion with him at that point
who had responsibility to make this decision? Did you feel you had the responsibility
to give instructions on the basis of having received this report
that some men were going to try to go after Oswald? Did you feel you had
any responsibility to take any protective action?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. At that moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No. The way it came to me, it was my feeling that this
was to happen when we attempted to transfer him, not to come up to the jail
and get him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do after you received that phone call?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I got up and dressed to come down to the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time did you arrive down at the office?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. About 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do when you got to the office?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Chief Stevenson and I got there about the same time. I
parked my car in the basement and we walked into the city hall or into the
police station, and we noticed a television camera set up in the areaway
leading into the garage.</p>

<p>I made the comment that they would have to do something about the television
camera because it was right in the path where they would bring the
prisoner out. There was no one around the camera. It was just sitting there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to hand you here, chief, a diagram of the inside of the
basement garage area. Do you have a pencil or anything that you can mark
with?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes. The camera&mdash;can I mark here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. The camera was sitting right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you put a "C" there so we know it is a camera.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. [Complies.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what television station had this camera there?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. It was KRLD.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What makes you think it was KRLD?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I just seem to recall that in my mind the letters on the
side of the camera. I could be wrong. It could have been a WBAP camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was the camera manned?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any other people in the basement area at that time?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was it that you instructed to move the camera?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I didn't instruct anybody at that moment. We merely
commented it was going to be moved, but instructed it to be moved later when
we came back down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do after you passed the camera?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Went up to the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you go?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Went through the basement and into the elevator and
went up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You went up to the third floor?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To your office. Do you remember what conversation you had
with Chief Stevenson along the way?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Well, we were commenting about that camera and that
they were going to have to move it, and we were going to have to man that
basement. But at the moment, plans hadn't jelled as to when we would move
him. Actually, back in our minds, I suppose, was the idea that when the
time came, that the sheriff's department would probably move him, because this
is customary in moving a prisoner. They normally come down and get the
prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you discuss with Chief Stevenson anywhere along the way
upstairs this phone call which you received from Mr. Talbert earlier in the
morning?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes; I think I mentioned that to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember anything about that conversation?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Not anything especially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether he knew or Stevenson knew at the time
you saw him down in the basement that there had been such a threat?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I believe he did. I think someone from one of his bureaus
had called him, if I remember right. It was rather common knowledge that
a call like that had been received.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you walked to the elevator in the basement, do you recall
whether or not there were any people in the basement?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; I don't remember anybody except those people in the
jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The people in the jail office were employees of the jail?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. They were the jail crew that stay on all night long; yes.
Not the all night. These would have been the morning shift just come on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At what time did that morning shift come on?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. At 7 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Chief, would you take this diagram and mark on there the
time that you believe you saw that camera?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. [Marks.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am marking this, "Dallas, Tex., Chief Batchelor, March 23,
1964, Deposition Exhibit No. 5000."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
As you walked into the building and went up to the third floor, did you see
anybody in the garage area or along the ramp or near the record room other
than police department employees?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what happened when you got up to the third floor? What
did you do?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I went to my office. I don't remember exactly what I did.
Chief Curry came in very shortly after that, and I went into this office and
we started discussing the possibility of moving the prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now will you try to remember who else was in the office with
Chief Curry when you walked in?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anybody come in after you?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Stevenson came in a little bit later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much later, would you say?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Oh, 2 or 3 minutes later, if I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anybody else come in after that during this conversation?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't recall that they did. I don't believe there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Chief Lunday come in?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No. Chief Lunday didn't come down until later in the
morning, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Captain Talbert join you?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Captain Talbert still on duty when you arrived at the police
department?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Captain Talbert was on duty that morning. He came on
at 7 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Talbert came on at 7, but as I understand it, Talbert called
you at your home about 6:30. How did that happen?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Well, he is a platoon commander, and a platoon commander
comes down early before the rest of the men to get his detail, and he had gotten
this information from the night commander. The information came into them
before they came on duty, and someone had tried to call Chief Curry. When
they came down, they told me about it and I called them and I told them to send
a squad by and wake Chief Curry up and tell him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What platoon was Talbert in charge of?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. The second platoon that month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. By "platoon," what do you mean?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. The first platoon is the night platoon that comes on theoretically
at midnight. It actually comes on at 11 o'clock the preceding day and
it goes to 7 o'clock the next morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What area does a platoon man?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. It mans the city. This is a uniform platoon. We have
three substations and they change the same way. The substations are under
the platoon commander, and each of the substations has a lieutenant in charge
of the substation who accounts to the platoon commander, who is a captain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell me if my understanding is right, that Talbert at this point
had operational responsibility for all the men throughout the city?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sort of like the executive officer on a ship or something?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us what your conversation was with Chief Curry up in his
office when you first went in?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I asked him, I believe, if he had called Sheriff Decker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. He said, no, he hadn't, but he was fixing to do that. And
he did do it. He picked up the phone and called Sheriff Decker.</p>

<p>This was&mdash;I got down around 9 o'clock&mdash;I mean around 8 o'clock, correction&mdash;and
it must have been somewhere around 8:30 or 8:45 when he called Decker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you talk with him before he called Sheriff Decker?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Just a few minutes. He called Sheriff Decker, and Decker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
said&mdash;and I was hearing only one side of the conversation, but I gathered that
Decker had told him he thought he was going to move the prisoner. Curry said,
"Well, if you want us to, we will." So he said, "I think you've got more manpower
than we have. You move him if you will."</p>

<p>Then we had discussed this threat that had been received <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Curry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Curry mention the threat to Decker in the telephone conversation?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I just don't remember whether he did or not. I would
think reasonably that he did, but I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Chief Curry talked with Decker, did he make any mention
of what time Oswald would be moved?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. He didn't set any definite time. He told him that Captain
Fritz wanted to question Oswald again that morning, and that when he got
through, they would be ready to move him, and he thought this would be sometime
after 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had Fritz begun to question Oswald when Curry was on the
telephone with Decker?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I really don't know. Shortly after we made the decision,
Curry went back to the office and they were questioning him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when Curry and Decker talked on the telephone on this
occasion, did Curry say anything about how Oswald would be moved?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Well, I think he called him back later and told him how
after we had talked, because we hadn't made the decision to use an armored
car to move him, armored truck, until after we had determined that he wasn't
going to move him and it was going to be our job. Then we decided to discuss
the armored car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Chief Curry have any discussion with Decker in this first
telephone conversation about the route that would be followed in moving Oswald?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't think so, because I am sure we didn't know at that
moment just exactly what we would do. He went back and talked to Fritz about
the advisability of this later, and we discussed it, and Stevenson came up and
discussed it, and our plan was to take him down Elm Street originally. We
would go out of the basement to Commerce, Commerce to Central Expressway,
north on Central to Elm, and then west on Elm to Houston, and then go back
east to the jail entrance door of the county jail and come in. This was our
original plan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In this first telephone conversation with Decker was Stevenson
present in Curry's office?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't believe he was. I know he wasn't when we started.
He may have walked in there while I was talking to him, but I believe Curry
and I was the only ones present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Curry finished talking with Decker and he hung up the
phone, did he say anything to you?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes; he said obviously Decker wants us to move him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I said we'd better start making some arrangements then.
And he said, "What do you think about getting an armored car, an armored
truck?"</p>

<p>And I said, "I think I know where I can get one."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. This was from the Armored Motor Car Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where is that located?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. It is on&mdash;what is the name of that street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the downtown area?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. It just borders on the downtown area. It is off of Ross
Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. North or south?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. It is north of Ross Avenue. I should think of the name of
the street. It is an old street here, but I just can't think of it offhand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the name of the armored car company again?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Armored Motor Car Service. It is actually a Fort Worth
company who services both Dallas and Fort Worth, and they have an office
here, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. After this, I told him that I thought I could get one. I
then went to the city directory to see who was in charge here, where I might get
ahold of his phone number. And I called the vice president at his home. This
was on Sunday morning. It was before he had gone to church. It must have been
somewhere around 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you give us the name of the vice president?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. It was Mr. Fleming. Mr. Fleming was the vice president,
and I talked to him at his home, and he told me that he would be glad to furnish
us one. As a matter of fact, he had two trucks which we could take our choice.
One was a small truck, but would accommodate only one passenger in the back.
The other one was what they call an overland truck, and it had seats on either
side in the back and would accommodate several people.</p>

<p>And I said, "I don't know whether this will go down to the basement or not."
But I asked him how tall it was and he said he didn't know, but he would have
it measured and let me know. And I told him that I would find out what the
height of the ramp was. We have a low place in the ramp as you go down
at the bottom of the ramp, and it is only 7 feet 5 inches tall at that point, so I
found out what that height was, and I called him back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now at the time you first talked with Mr. Fleming, did you
indicate to him what time you would need the armored vehicle?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes; I told him sometime around 10 or a little after. And
he said he would get there as quickly as possible. He had to call a crew down
to man the truck. And Mr. Hall, who is their Dallas representative here,
brought the truck down with another driver driving the small one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was the truck brought down?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. It was brought down&mdash;probably it wasn't at 10 o'clock,
because they didn't get there that early. It must have been closer to 11 o'clock
when they finally got down there with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you say anything else to Mr. Fleming during this first
telephone conversation? Did you tell him anything about the route?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't believe that I told him the route we were going
to take, no. I know I didn't tell him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were on the telephone with Mr. Fleming, where was
Chief Curry, if you know?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. He was in his office. I called Mr. Fleming from my office.
I left his office and went into my office and called him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Chief Stevenson, where was he?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. He was either in his office or in Chief Curry's office with
him. We were all together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time that Curry got off the first telephone call with
Decker, was there anything that Stevenson was supposed to do?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Well, he and I both, under Chief Curry's instructions, he
said you'd better go downstairs and see what manpower you will need to cover
that basement down there. One other thing, Chief Lumpkin had come in and
he was the man I asked to find out for me how tall that ramp was down there,
what the clearance was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did Lumpkin go down there before or after you called
Fleming?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I think he went down there. He called somebody down
that knew how tall it was, but that was after I talked to Fleming the first
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does your office, Chief, maintain any records of outgoing telephone
calls?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time that you were talking to Fleming, between the time
that the chief talked with Decker and you talked with Fleming, would there
have been any occasion for a dispatcher to make any particular communication
to the people in the field as a result of the conversation with Decker?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir. As a matter of fact, nobody knew this. I mean,
except the few people on the staff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I realize that nobody would have known about the particular
contents of the conversation, but what I am getting at is, is there any reason
that somebody might have said at this point he knew you were going to have to
make a move, you'd better dispatch the men in? You'd better send out a general
call to bring in more men?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. This would have been handled in a telephone conversation
with the dispatcher, yet nobody would know the real reason for it. Talbert did
have some men called in. He did have some men called in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did Talbert come to make this call in relation to the
conversation?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't know, unless he was anticipating. Well, I don't
know how to say it. It had gotten on the radio and in the newspapers and
everywhere else that this was going to be at 10 o'clock, I presume, because there
was people all up and down the street, across the street from the city hall on
Commerce waiting for this thing to happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were they waiting there when you came in at 8 o'clock?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Oh, there wasn't anybody there that early, but they were
down there around 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you think of anything that might have happened in the
ordinary course of things after Decker and Curry talked, that would have been
recorded in the police department?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. About the movement of the prisoner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No. I am particularly referring to the movement of the prisoner,
but I am thinking of something that might pinpoint the time in which this
conversation with Decker occurred, that Curry might have said at this point,
"All right, Stevenson, bring in so many men," and Stevenson would have told the
dispatcher to send out a call, and nobody would have known the purpose of the
call, but it would fix a time?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Stevenson went back after we determined we were going
to have to secure the basement and move the prisoner. He went back to his
bureau and had them send some men down there, some detectives.</p>

<p>He didn't have to call them from the field. He had them back there.</p>

<p>Talbert sent out and got some men, and I don't know whose direction he did
that on, but we went down there to see what manpower we would need. And
when we got there, he had them there, and where he got this information, I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now after you talked with Fleming the first time, what did you
do? After you finished that telephone conversation?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. We went downstairs and that is when we had instructed
them&mdash;it was Wiggins, I believe, in the jail office, to get that camera out of
there. And we instructed them&mdash;Curry went down with us, too, and there were
two cars sitting across from the jail exit door. They were sitting in these
places right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to take a pen and mark?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. And we had these cars moved [marking on exhibit].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time of the morning would you estimate that was?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. This must have been about 9:30 or 9:15, somewhere along
in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to mark what you think the approximate time was in
between the two cars where you marked?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. [Indicates time.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any other cars in the basement area at that time?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes; there was several other cars. Chief Curry's car was
over here, and mine was over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is in the chief's normal parking place?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. These all are our normal spaces.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to mark those in there?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. [Marks.]</p>

<p>Mine is over here, and I don't know whether Chief Fisher was in there or not.
I don't remember his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to put the time in between those two also?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. [Marks time.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time they were parked in there, the time that you are
talking about right now that you saw them there. That is the same time that
was on the other cars?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. They were there all morning. They were parked there
and they stayed there up until we moved them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So they were there at 9:15 to 9:30?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. [Marks on chart.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there other cars in the basement area?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes, there were others. I don't recall just exactly. It
wasn't full. It was a Sunday, and Chief Stevenson's car was parked over here
somewhere, and Chief Lunday's, Lumpkin's car was parked here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there general traffic of police cars in and out of the garage?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. There would have been. However, on Sunday morning,
that time of day there is very little traffic in and out of there. It is one of the
quietest times. There were two or three other cars parked in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you went down to the basement at that time, were there
news people in the basement?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes, sir. When we went down in there the next time, there
was some cameras setting up here that had just been rolled in. They weren't
operative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let's focus on this trip that you took downstairs with, was it
Stevenson?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At 9:15 or 9:30. What is your best estimate of the number of
news people that were down there?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't know. I can tell you a better estimate when we
finally went down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it crowded or sparsely crowded?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. It wasn't crowded; no. There wasn't any big congregation.
There may be two or three people from&mdash;some television people standing around
there, trying to get set up, and they had some cables and stuff in there, and the
best I remember, we told them they were going to have to move those cables out
of there. And we instructed Lieutenant Wiggins to move these two vehicles out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Those were the two that are on the Main Street side of the
entrance into the garage area?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes, north side. And that we were going to have this for
the news media to stand behind the rail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Right where the two cars were that you wanted to be moved?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes; and we instructed the television people that they would
have to put their cameras on this side of the driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to any newspeople yourself?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I didn't myself. I was present there. I don't remember
exactly who directed, whether it was Chief Curry or Stevenson or myself, but
I mean it was three of us standing there, and we all agreed that this needed
to be done, and one of us told them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now this first trip down to the basement, what did you do
besides direct that the two cars on either side of the garage entrance be
moved, and that the camera be moved back there?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. We went over in here, and there were some detectives around
in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now can you indicate in words what you are referring to on
the map?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. They were along in here. There was a man over here
by this elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. City hall elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The first place that you referred to was the entrance way in
the garage. Were some people congregated there, and was there a man at
the No. 1 or No. 2 elevator?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who he was?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; I didn't pay any attention to who he was. It was a
uniformed man standing over there. I later learned this was a reserve that
was over there, but I didn't pay any attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The uniformed man was a reserve officer?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you later learn that from?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. In the course of the investigation later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Some days after Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now after going over near the elevator where the uniformed
reserve officer was, what did you do next?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Well, we went back upstairs. And Stevenson had gone at
this time. We went down this first time to see the layout, and there wasn't
too many here. We went back upstairs, and Chief Stevenson sent some detectives
down, and brought his uniformed men in. I came down the last time, was just
before the removal of the prisoner, and in the meantime I had contacted Mr.
Fleming about the armored motor car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You came down three times?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I went up once, and then Stevenson and I came down and
looked this thing over, and then down with Curry, and then the last time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the first occasion when you were down there, you say you
saw this uniformed reserve officer. Did you later learn what his name was?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't remember it. It is in the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you mark with an "X" on the map where that reserve
officer was standing and the approximate time?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. (marking). He was standing over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let the record indicate that he has marked it with a circle.
This is again somewhere around 9:15 or 9:30?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Somewhere along there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you learn in the course of your investigation his name?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't recall his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would that appear anywhere in the report, do you think?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Not in that report. It would appear in the reports that
were made by Captain Jones in the course of investigating who was where.
You have a diagram similar to this with everybody marked on it, and he is on
one of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had he been stationed there by somebody?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes; now I could be mistaken about the exact time I saw
him there. That is, whether it was this trip or the trip before. I could be
mistaken about it, but I do remember seeing him here when we came down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Excuse me, do you want to mark the map then what the
alternate time might be? You might write whatever time you think it was.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. (marking). He was there before then, but I am talking
about when I may have seen him there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, Chief, after you left the basement area on this first trip,
where did you go?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. We went back upstairs to the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Chief Stevenson go back up with you?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got back up on the third floor, were there news media
personnel on the third floor?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. There were some up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it, it was not what you consider a crowded condition.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there television cameras still there?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you arrived at 8 o'clock in the morning, were there TV
cameras up there?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were the TV cameras manned at 8 o'clock in the morning?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes; the best I remember, they were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what TV stations had cameras up there at that
time?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. It was KRLD and WFAA, if I remember right. And I
could be mistaken about the WFAA. It could have been WBAP.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you happen to remember KRLD?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. They were the first ones in there and they had their truck
parked outside. And also, I am pretty sure it was WFAA, because WFAA had
a truck parked on the Harwood Street side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you able to tell at 8 o'clock in the morning if they were
shooting footage?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I couldn't tell. All the time that I remember, they had
these little viewers in the back of the thing and you could see through them and
see what was going on through them, look through the camera. Whether they
were shooting footage, there wasn't anything to shoot that morning. It was
pretty quiet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, the second trip when you came back upstairs after your
first trip downstairs, where did you go?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. After the first trip, I came back up to again get in touch
with Mr. Stevenson and tell him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Fleming?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Fleming, I mean, and tell him what the height of that
thing was. Then he told me, well, I will just send both trucks down there and
you can take the one you want.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This second phone call, was Mr. Fleming at home?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whether Fleming had been contacted by anyone
in your office or Decker's office or anybody else prior to your first phone call
to him?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I would think not. He couldn't, because this was his first
knowledge of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you tell us what else you said to him? What else this
conversation involved?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't recall saying anything other than expressing our
appreciation for his help. And he said he would send both of the trucks down.
I told him how to bring the trucks. I told him to bring them east on Harwood&mdash;I
mean on Commerce Street, and that we would back it down the ramp so that
we would be leaving the ramp in the right direction when they pulled out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Up to the time that you had this second conversation with
Fleming, had you discussed with anybody the route by which you would take
Oswald to the county jail?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Nobody but Chief Curry, that I recall, and probably Chief
Stevenson. As a matter of fact, this route that they were to take was worked
out more between Stevenson and Curry and Fritz than it was with me. My
primary job here was to get the truck and get the cars placed, and it was
decided that Chief Curry would lead the car down there, followed by a car
of detectives, and then the armored car, and then followed by another car of
detectives, and then followed by Stevenson and I in a rear car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This planned route of the movement was to go from Commerce
to Central Expressway, left to Elm Street, then down Elm Street?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. To Houston; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now as a result of that decision, were any cars or officers called
in from the field?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Talbert called his officers in. He had called and scattered
them up. And then there was some discussion about taking it down Main
Street, and I am not too sure where I got this information, but anyway, he
sent a sergeant and moved those officers over a block to Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why was the route changed?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Well, I don't know. The route was changed without my
knowing it, really. When they decided to take Oswald in an automobile instead
of the armored car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who participated in that decision?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Chief Curry, Chief Stevenson, Captain Fritz, I believe&mdash;I
was not in there when it was discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After you talked to Fleming the second time what did you do?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Then he said he would send them over, and we went down
there to get the cars lined up. This must have been, oh, probably 10:45, 10:30
to 10:45. I went downstairs and I saw the basement well covered. We had a
man at the top of the ramp on Main Street. We had several men in the basement
leading into the garage area just before you get to the jail office, and I
went through there, and Stevenson was with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me interrupt you here, Chief. I think I will pull out another
map so that we can mark it. I am going to mark this map, for the
purpose of identification, "Dallas, Tex., Chief Batchelor, March 23, 1964, Deposition
Exhibit 5001." Now I want you to use this exhibit, Chief, to indicate
what you saw on this second trip downstairs, which you indicated would be
what time?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I came out of the elevator into the basement and saw a
number of officers across this area right here. There were several detectives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you mark that with "X's"?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. [Marking.] Detective there. We walked through here.
We noticed these cameras had been moved out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are talking about the passageway past the jail office?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Past this jail office here. I noticed that inside the jail
office there were three or four photographers inside the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At that point, you were at the jail office door nearest to the ramp
driveway, and you looked in that door and you saw some news people?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes; photographers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you recognize any of them?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't recall them. We went in there and moved them
out. We went and instructed the jail supervisor that there was to be no one
in that jail office except officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was the supervisor?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Lieutenant Wiggins. And we moved them out and we
instructed the reporters, and there were a number of them down there at that
time, by no means all of them, that&mdash;later there were, but there was a good
many&mdash;we told them they would have to stand back over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is against the railing?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Along the railing. And they had set up two TV cameras
behind this railing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you mark with an "S," where the two cameras were set
up?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. [Marking.] Then there was another one right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that third camera there when you came down at 10:45?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't think so. That was the one sitting over there.
These were the two sitting out here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now the two cameras that you placed there had been originally
near the record room?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you see them near the record room? When you came
in in the morning?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No. That trip down after we came down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you take Exhibit 5000, and would you mark those two
TV cameras that you saw on the first trip?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. [Marks.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe you said that that time was 9:15?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes; now they had been moved here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Behind the railing?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Behind the railing, and this was one sitting here. That was
dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are marking in the entrance to the garage off the Main
Street ramp?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That camera that you are marking there in the garage?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Not operating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. By that, do you mean that <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. It wasn't hooked up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But the other two cameras which you have marked behind
the railing, were they taking shots when you walked down?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; I don't know that they were at that time. They didn't
have any lights on, no floodlights on, and they had been told to keep their
floodlights off. They didn't turn them on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Prior to the time that you came down on the second trip at
about 10:45, did you discuss with anybody up on the third floor where you
wanted these TV people placed and what you wanted done with the lights?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. We told the men down here, and we told the reporters
down here, just kind of announced to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you walked down?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes. Some of them&mdash;one of the supervisors came in and
said they couldn't get them all along here and wanted to know if it would be
all right to put them along here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are indicating at the bottom of the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Main Street entrance ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Between the railing and jail office?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. And the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. They wanted to put their cameras there?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; it wasn't cameras. They just wanted to stand there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you tell them?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Since we couldn't get them in there, he told them if they
would stay back, they could stay there. And there were some officers that were
stationed along there to hold them back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But your original hope was that all of the news media people
could be in the entrance to the garage?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. And they were scattered along here, too. Scattered along
the entrance into the garage itself and along here, but some of them, there
just wasn't room for them, and some got across here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain downstairs on this second trip?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't think this is the second trip. I think, well, I guess
it is. But I came down here, and Stevenson and I looked this thing over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are going to have to indicate in words.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. We looked over the basement to see that the security was
in order. I noticed an officer at the Main Street ramp.</p>

<p>We walked up the Commerce Street ramp and noticed a crowd of people across
Commerce Street, and was told by one of the supervisors that they were keeping
them across there, and that they allowed no one on the side next to the police
station of the city hall except officers. And the only people over here were
either reservists or regular officers. They had officers across the street. Chief
Lunday told me they had officers down at the courthouse across from the jail
entrance. Was keeping that crowd back there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now as you looked along the sidewalk on the north side of Commerce
Street, from the Commerce Street ramp to Pearl&mdash;from the Commerce
Street ramp to Pearl Expressway&mdash;in other words, in the direction of the
municipal building, could you see how the police officers were spaced, and how
many officers were along the north side of Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Well, it is a good ways to Pearl, and the crowd didn't
extend anywhere near down to Pearl Street. It was mostly just across from the
building up to Harwood Street rather than Pearl. There weren't that many
people there. It wasn't like a parade. I guess there were, oh, a couple of
hundred people across there, perhaps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whether or not there was a police officer at the
corner of Pearl and Commerce?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't know. I don't remember whether there was or not.
I'm sure there must have been one stationed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you walked out on the sidewalk and were talking about
this 10:45 trip down to the basement, what did you do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I turned around and walked back in there. They had
parked Chief Curry's car out east of the Commerce Street ramp on the street,
double parked, parallel to some parked cars that were already there. Then I
drove my car out of the basement and parked it west of the Commerce Street
ramp exit, and I double parked it also right behind his, the intention being that
when this convoy came out, that he would lead off and I would drop in behind
Chief Curry with Chief Stevenson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you mark on the map where Chief Curry's car was and
where your car was placed on Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. This confuses me a little here. There is not any offset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Unfortunately, this black line that confuses you represents a
basement wall. It doesn't represent the street.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. [Marks on map.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do after you moved your car out on Commerce
Street?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Shortly after that just within a few minutes these armored
cars arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you standing when the armored cars arrived?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I was in the basement, but somebody told me down there,
shouted that these armored cars had arrived, so I came up again out of the
ramp to look at the two cars to see which one we wanted. I looked in the inside
of the larger armored car and decided that this one is the one we would have
to use because it had room not only for the prisoner, but two guards to be placed
in there with him.</p>

<p>And this one&mdash;Mr. Hall, I believe is his name&mdash;I think it is Mr. Hall that
drove the truck up there. And this truck was too large or too tall to drive
clear to the foot of the basement ramp. It wouldn't clear this ceiling at that
point, so I asked Mr. Hall to back it in, and he started backing it in, and he
got the truck inside of the ramp with all of the body inside and the cab on the
outside, on the sidewalk. He stopped and suggested that he not go to the
bottom of the ramp with it because of its weight. He was afraid that in trying
to pull out, he might kill the motor and stall it on the ramp, and suggested that
since it blocked the entrance, if we could use it from that point, he would
rather it go from that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the point this conversation took place, had you or anyone
else to your knowledge told Hall what route would be taken?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; we told him he would follow a lead car, and pointed
out the car that he would follow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At that point, did you indicate to him how soon it would be
before Oswald would be brought down?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir; this truck was parked in the ramp, and I thought
that this would be a safe place to park it because on one side of the truck next
to the west wall of the ramp there was only about 12 inches of space. And between
the truck and the east wall, there was only 18 to 24 inches of space. I
placed an officer between the west wall and the truck, which totally blocked it.
And I placed two officers between the truck and the east wall, and that totally
blocked that. Then I believe it was Lieutenant Smart and I got in the truck
and searched it. We found a soft drink bottle in the truck, which we took out.
I found a loose bolt lying on the floor, which I took out.</p>

<p>There was a device on the back side of the truck which was sort of a gauge
and a lever which I didn't understand what it was and I asked Mr. Hall what
that was, and he said it was an emergency brake in the event something happened
to the driver, that whoever was in the back of the truck could pull that
lever and stop the truck. We got these items out of the truck and took them
away, left the back doors of the truck open to receive the prisoner, and then I
went back down to the foot of the ramp and waited, and in a few minutes
shortly after the arrival of the truck, Chief Stevenson came down, and this
was, oh, nearly 11:30. It was just a matter of minutes before&mdash;and told
me of the change of plans, and that they were going to send the truck in convoy
down through Elm Street, and that the car <span class="locked">carrying&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mean Main Street?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; Elm Street, and that the truck carrying Oswald and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
a car of detectives would drop out of the convoy, out on Main Street and drive
down Main Street by themselves. In other words, the truck was to be a decoy,
and the lead car and all the other cars would follow it on down Elm Street, while
the car carrying the prisoner would go down Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What security was there going to be?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. We had moved the officers over from Elm Street to Main
Street on the corner. The only security would have been a car carrying detectives,
following the car carrying the prisoner and detectives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How were the officers moved, by a radio dispatcher, or was
somebody sent out?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. A sergeant was sent out, a three-wheeler. Talbert had it
done. I don't recall who did that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you know at this point whether there was an officer
stationed at the corner of Main and Commerce? Main and Pearl Expressway?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; I don't know whether there was or not.</p>

<p>(Short recess had.)</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't we state this for the record, that we have had a
recess and an off-the-record discussion between Mr. Griffin and Chief Batchelor,
and so that the record may be clear about where the policemen who were to
guard the route which was originally planned for the transfer of Oswald, on
the streets of the city of Dallas, I will let Chief Batchelor at this time explain
where they were originally to be stationed, and where they were moved to.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. They were originally stationed along Elm Street, and later
were moved to Main Street where the prisoner would actually go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe that before we took the recess that I was asking you
if at the time that you were down in the basement and examining the armored
car, you were aware that a man was or was not stationed at the corner of
Main and Pearl Expressway?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I do not know. I was not aware. I hadn't given that any
thought at the time. Actually, Main and Expressway would pose no traffic
problem of a turning movement, at that point, because Pearl Expressway, which
is a one-way street, and the convoy would have been next to the curb, and it
would pose no problem at this point, trafficwise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Chief Stevenson came downstairs and told you that the
route had been changed, where did he tell you that the caravan would turn off
Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. On Central Expressway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When it turned left on Central Expressway, where would it
next turn?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. The convoy would go to Elm Street, but the prisoner and
a car of detectives would turn off at Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you discuss with him the reasoning behind this decoy?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I merely asked him why the change, and he said they
decided to change it up in the Homicide Bureau in a discussion with Chief
Curry, because if anyone attacked, they would have the prisoner in a car
separate from the convoy and the public would not know this, and they thought
this would be a wise move.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you all were aware that the TV cameras were going to be
focusing on the car or the vehicle that Oswald was placed in, didn't you? The
people in the downtown streets wouldn't be able to see that, but there were also
newsmen down there who were broadcasting and they would be able to tell
people listening in on the radio what car?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. You are arguing with me. I had nothing to do with moving
the prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I didn't mean to argue with you, chief.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I didn't make the decision and I don't know whether it was
wise or not. It is a moot question now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, what next happened after you talked with Chief
Stevenson about this change in plan?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. This happened when he told me about it, just moments
before they actually brought him down, and he told me they were bringing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
car up on the ramp, two cars up on the ramp, one to carry the prisoner and one
to carry the detectives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me go back one bit here. You stated that you came down.
This one time you are talking about was an episode where you went through
the armored car, and this would have been your third trip downstairs?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. And my last one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And your last one. Now the first trip that you came down the
stairs was when you saw these reserve officers over by the elevators?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Actually, that was the second trip down, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That would have been about what time?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Oh, probably 10 or 10:15, somewhere along in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. So that the trip that we have been referring to in the
past, the 10:45 trip, is really most clearly distinguished by <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I may be a little mixed up on my time, but the last trip,
the trip we are talking about when we searched the armored car and put that in
place, that was fairly close to the movement of the prisoner, and I would say
somewhere around 10:45 to 11 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now that happened somewhere around 11:20?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. About 10:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you never went back upstairs, from the time that you moved
your automobile up onto Commerce Street and the time that you searched the
armored car?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; Chief Stevenson did, but I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long would you say you were downstairs from the time
that you walked down and moved your car out on the street and Oswald
arrived?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Possibly 30 minutes or 35.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now after you finished examining the armored car and you
talked with Chief Stevenson, did you get a chance to look at the placement of the
news personnel, the news media people in the basement?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Shortly before he came down, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now looking toward the Main Street ramp, how many rows deep,
if there was more than one row at all, were the policemen who were blocking
the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. How many rows deep were the policemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I'm sorry, the news people, if you understand what I mean?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. There was about, as I remember it, about two deep along
there. Some places there might have been a third man behind, but most about
two deep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you come here and mark along the Main Street ramp
about how deep these people were?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. [Marking.] There weren't many along there because there
were cameras there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many people would you estimate were in that area there?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Oh, there couldn't have been too many in that particular
area there. It is only 15 feet wide, maybe 20 or 25 in there, maybe 30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, just before Oswald was brought down, where were the
rest of the news people placed?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. They were along here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is blocking the garage entrance?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how many people would you say were in that area?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't know. Altogether there must have been, gee, we had
around 70 policemen in that basement altogether, and there must have been 60
or 70 reporters and photographers and press people. They were fairly deep
across here. But this is wider and they were two or three deep across there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to mark in there where you have indicated?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. [Marks chart.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you say that they were deeper across the entrance to
the garage than they were blocking the Main Street ramp, or were they about the
same?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I wasn't paying too close attention to how deep they were.
There was more than one line of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There was?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes; they were two to three deep across here [marking].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there police officers in there also?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes; there was police officers intermingling all along here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you given any instructions to the police officers up to this
point as to how they should stand in relationship, where they should be facing?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now after talking with Chief Stevenson, what next happened?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Almost immediately the car containing Lieutenant Pierce
and I believe Sergeant Maxey pulled out of here, and these people had to step
back, and they pulled out, and the detective cars were pulled here in on the
ramp and backed into position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Chief, at this point, just before Oswald was brought down, were
there any automobiles in the portion of the garage which would be the north
half of the garage, do you recall?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. As I recall it, there were one or two vehicles parked back
in here, police vehicles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Were there any police vehicles, and if you don't have
any recollection, state that. Do you recall if there were any police vehicles
along the railing of the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't recall. If there were, they were back from this
entrance. There weren't any in the immediate entrance to the jail door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if there were any people other than the people
manning these TV cameras, behind the railing?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't recall that. I don't think there were, because these
people here went up to just about where the cameras were. This curved a little
bit around here. It wasn't just a straight line. It would curve a little bit like
this, then, but they were standing away from the front of those cameras, because
those cameras were on a tripod at a level on the floor, which was lower
than this ramp level.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as Pierce and Maxey's car went up the ramp, did you
watch it go up the ramp?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do as it went up the ramp?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't recall. I was up here. I was more concerned with
this truck here and getting this truck out of there when this thing started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you watch Pierce and Maxey's car go through the line of
newsmen?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I saw it. I <span class="locked">wasn't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you paying any attention?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Not particularly. I do remember seeing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After Pierce and Maxey's car broke through the line of newsmen,
what do you remember next happening?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I remember backing these or pulling up these two detective
cars that were to carry Oswald, and one detective pulled up here a little ways,
and he had to pull up a little further so this one could get up, and they then
backed up. And this one had hardly gotten in place, barely had stopped, when
somebody shouted, "Here he comes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, now, are you sure&mdash;how certain are you that these
two detective cars pulled out after Pierce and Maxey?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't think Pierce and Maxey could have gotten out with
those two detective cars where they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sounds pretty good to me.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. While they were in place, they couldn't have pulled around
here, because they were blocking this entrance here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, who drove those two detective cars?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't recall. Men out of the Homicide Bureau, but I
don't know which ones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are they listed in this report, do you recall?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't think they are listed in that report. I am pretty
sure they are not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Detective Brown?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Where do you see that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is on page 32. "Stevenson then proceeded across the driveway
to the entrance to the garage where Detective C.&nbsp;W. Brown, driving one
car, and Detective Dhority, driving the second car, was preparing to pull the
cars behind the armored car." Do you remember Brown or Dhority walking
to the cars in the basement?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I wasn't directing my attention to them at the moment
they did that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know or have you heard whether they were sitting in
those cars for a long period of time, or a few minutes, or whether <span class="locked">they&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't know, but I imagine so. I think they came down
for that express purpose, after this plan was changed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you standing as the rear car&mdash;that is, the car closest
to the exit from the jail <span class="locked">office&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I was standing over in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you place an "X" on the map where you were standing?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Well, I don't remember exactly where I was standing at
the time that they pulled those cars up, but I think I was standing over here,
and then moved to this position as they were backing in, because I had been
talking to Chief Stevenson just about that time, and we were talking right
up in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now at the time you heard the shots fired, would you place on
this map where these two automobiles were and where you were standing?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. One car was right here, approximately, and the other car
was ahead of it, and I am not drawing this in very good proportion, but this
is the order they were in, and I was standing, and this I know in good order,
because I was standing about midway of this thing, which was along about the
back fender of this car, that I was standing right along here. But these cars
were larger than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't you cross out that Ford car there and redraw it up
where it was?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I was standing here, and this one was back here more in
this position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you put your name where you have made the circle?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. (Marks on chart.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now do you remember what other officers or people were around
you?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; I don't remember who. There was a whole bunch of
people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What happened when you heard the shot fired? What did you
do?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Well, actually before the shot was fired, when I was standing
along here, and when somebody shouted, "Here he comes." I started to
go to that truck, that armored truck and close the doors on it, the back doors
so it could take off. And I turned to do that when I heard the shot. I hadn't
taken over a step or two over to the door when he was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I turned around and looked back and came over there.
There was a whole group of people had him down. It was a <span class="locked">big&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had Ruby down?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Had Ruby down. They had pulled Oswald into the jail
office, and then pulled Ruby in behind him.</p>

<p>I went into the jail office to look at them, and they had Ruby down on the
floor on his back and was trying to handcuff him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let's focus on the time when they had Ruby down on the
ground out there on the ramp, the ramp area. Where did you stand at that
point?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I stood off in the crowd. I didn't even see what was going
on. There was such a crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear Ruby say anything at that point?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear any of the police officers say anything?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir; not when I walked right up there to it. But I did
hear someone shout, "Jack, don't you so-and-so," but this was before they got him
down. I mean, this was almost simultaneous with the shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you follow Ruby and Oswald into the jail office then?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. After a little bit, a minute or two after, I remained in the
jail office and asked Lieutenant Wiggins if they had called an ambulance, and
he said they had.</p>

<p>I walked over and looked at Oswald, and this intern had come in and was
giving him some pressure on his lower rib section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you see Ruby at that time?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I saw him on the floor. I couldn't see him too well. There
was several men on top. He was still struggling in the jail office, but they had
already gotten the gun away from him and they were trying to get him handcuffed
and get him down and laying still, but he was fighting them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear him say anything?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; I don't recall anything he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear the officers say anything to him?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain there?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Just a few minutes. The ambulance came almost immediately.
It was just&mdash;I walked out of there before the ambulance came and
walked back. Someone shouted right after this happened, and there was a lot
of confusion, and someone shouted, "Don't let anybody out."</p>

<p>There were a bunch of reporters that started running like they were frightened.
I suppose they were running to telephones, but they tried to run up the Main
Street ramp, and I remember very clearly the officer at the top of the ramp
pulling his gun and said, "Get back down."</p>

<p>They turned around and walked back down, but most of them escaped through
the corridor. Not out the ramp, but went out through the corridor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is the corridor that leads from the record room to Commerce
Street?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Well, yes. They escaped out the corridor off the hallway
that leads in front of the jail office into the Records Bureau, and then to Commerce
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they escape out Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't know where they went from there, whether they
went upstairs to use the telephone, or out in the street. But there would have
been nobody over there that heard the command not to let them out. This
was kind of a spontaneous command.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What percentage of people would you say got out of the basement?
News media people got out of the basement that way?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't know. They scattered pretty quickly. Still a lot
hung around after it was over. I would say half, at least, got out that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were you in the jail office when Ruby was taken upstairs in
the elevator?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Was I in the jail office when he was taken upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I went as soon as the ambulance came and got him, I ran up
the ramp and told him to get that truck out of there, that it was blocking the
entrance to the ramp, and then I left and went upstairs and told Chief Curry
what happened. By the time I got up there, somebody called him and he knew
what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do next?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Lord, I don't remember what I did next. We sat there kind
of dumbfounded for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did there come a time during the rest of the day when you talked
with Ruby?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I never did talk with Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall the rumors, stories that began to come in about
how Ruby got down into the basement?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. In the course of the next day or two we heard lots of
rumors that he had a press card. This was the prevailing rumor, that he had
a press card, but there wasn't a press card found on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am trying to direct your attention to the events fairly close
after the time of, the time Oswald was shot. What did you do in connection
with attempting to find out how Ruby got down in that basement?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't know that I did anything specifically to try to find
that out. We began to think in terms of an overall investigation into the
matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Chief Curry convene any sort of meeting or gather together
any of the top officers to discuss this?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. He discussed it with Lumpkin and Stevenson and I. I
don't recall exactly when this happened, whether it happened just&mdash;I am sure
it didn't happen just immediately after it happened, because there were obvious
things that would take place first, and that would be the investigation,
that homicide would carry on, an interrogation of Ruby himself.</p>

<p>We even got some rumors the next day that some of our officers had borrowed
money from a bank and Ruby was a cosigner on the note, and we ran
a check at every bank in Dallas, but the banks where this&mdash;the most probable
one was the Republic Bank. We ran a check there by sending the name of
everybody that was in that basement over to the bank, and having them check
for us and see if they had any notes on these people.</p>

<p>We also checked with, I believe, the Mercantile, and we checked with the
Oak Cliff Bank and Trust Co., because Ruby happened to live out in that area.</p>

<p>We didn't know whether he had an account, but none of them found anything
to date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This meeting or a little conference that you referred to that you
and Curry and Lumpkin and Stevenson had, about how long after Oswald was
shot did this occur?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't remember whether that was that day or the next
day, but it resulted in Chief Curry pulling some men out of the special service
division with Captain Jones in charge, and we had about six men on the team
besides the captain to investigate every aspect of this, which was in terms
of locating all of the people that were assigned down there, locating as many
of the press as they knew were down there, and getting statements from all
of these people. Then also we discovered this matter of this money order,
and we followed that thing out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you personally talk with Officer Dean at any time on the
Sunday that Oswald was shot? After Ruby shot Oswald, did you talk to Dean?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Dean said something to me, and I don't remember whether
it was Sunday or not. I believe it was Sunday afternoon, sometime, or evening,
to the effect that he had been up and talked to Ruby with Mr. Sorrels, I believe
was present there, and that Ruby told him he came down that ramp.</p>

<p>He told him that an officer, that a car came in, and an officer stopped and
talked with the fellows in the car, and while he was talking to them, he walked
down there.</p>

<p>There is nothing to indicate that the officer did talk to the officers that went
out other than maybe to speak to them. I mean, but it appears evident now
that while the officer did walk away momentarily a few feet from the entrance
is when he got in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Dean made this statement to you, did you know that
he had spoken to a newspaper reporter also?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whether this conversation you had with Dean
was before or after he spoke to the newspaper people?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have an occasion to talk with an officer by the name
of Newman that day?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have occasion to talk to Officer Vaughn on that day?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; over on top of the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; as a matter of fact, I never have talked with Vaughn.
And I wasn't talking to Dean in the nature of interrogating. He voluntarily
told me this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was anybody else present when Dean told you that?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't recall that there was. I don't think there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where this conversation occurred?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; it was there in the city hall, but I don't remember
exactly where. It was probably up on the third floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now I am going to mark for identification, "Dallas, Tex., Chief
Batchelor, March 23, 1964, Exhibit 5002."</p>

<p>Can you tell us briefly what that is, Chief?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. That is a monthly assignment board or bulletin, which
has the names of all the members of the police department in it and their assignments
for the month of November 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that a true and accurate roster of the people who were employed
in the department on the day that Ruby shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. It would be, with the exception of any few that might have
been reassigned, or any few that might have, in the course of the month, been
transferred from one division to another, which occurs frequently. But for
the most part it is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or, also a few that had been hired?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Or a few that had been hired during that month. They are
not on there; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you and I have spoken at some length during the last day,
not counting the length of time we spent here. Do you recall that in your office
this morning we talked some about security measures in the protection of the
President?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any suggestions that you would make as to how,
as a result of your experience, you think the President might be more effectively
protected?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't know how you would correct this exactly. One
of the problems that we experienced was the fact that such, of such a short
time to do some of the planning that we had.</p>

<p>We didn't know until just one afternoon, actually, in terms of Love Field
security, actually where the President's plane would be placed.</p>

<p>We didn't know until 2 days before his arrival what the parade route would
be. This posed some problem in terms of assignment of personnel and properly
instructing personnel as to what their procedures should be.</p>

<p>I think one thing that would be helpful would be for a standard general procedure
of things that those responsible for protection of the President could
put out to police departments such as certain standard types of coverage that
would always apply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you give us any example from your own experience where
this would have been useful on this unfortunate trip?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. One thing you need in a situation like this is explicit
written instructions to officers as to such things as watching the crowd rather
than the President.</p>

<p>This is a general accepted thing in most police departments.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have new personnel that comes in and they need to be told
this specifically. We had an instance in which we were asked to guard all
of the overpasses, railroad and vehicular, and we instructed the officers verbally
that they were to let no unauthorized personnel on these overpasses. But there
was no definition of what "authorized personnel" was.</p>

<p>And in one case, there were people on an overpass which the President had
never reached.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this the triple railroad overpass at the base of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes; they would have just gone under, or would have gone
under momentarily had he not been shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
There were a number of railroad track workers on this overpass, and we
had officers up there, but they considered them to be authorized personnel because
they worked for the railroad, and they were all lined along there watching
for the parade which never did go under them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many persons do you remember having been up there?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I was not there. I heard about it. I understand there
were probably 10 or 12 people up there. But actually, there should be nobody
over the immediate route the President goes under. But there are certainly,
there seems to me, certain generally accepted procedures that, and certain
general types of security that every police department ought to be aware of, that
is standard operating procedure, plus whatever specific thing that the various
circumstances might want done; some sort of suggested procedure on their
part, with it published, that might be helpful to police organizations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to go off the record here a moment.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let's go on the record on this.</p>

<p>We have been speaking off the record about other suggestions which Chief
Batchelor has, and one of the things that he has pointed out is that there is
not enough advance notice of what the Presidential route is going to be to
enable the police department to satisfactorily handle the administrative problems
of selecting people to place them at particular intersections.</p>

<p>Do you want to add any more to that statement that I have made of what
you have just told me?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No. I realize there is another aspect on this too, on the
part of the Secret Service, that they want, that is, that they don't want too
much advance notice to the public. This is the reason I am not criticizing.</p>

<p>(Further discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me go on the record and ask you a question here. Do you
think, Chief, it would have been possible to station people in the middle of
the downtown block with the instructions to watch various buildings in a
periphery of their vision.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes. This would be feasible. We did have men in the
middle of the downtown, several of them in each block, they were primarily
watching the crowd of people rather than the windows.</p>

<p>When you are in an area of skyscrapers and you are standing right at the
foot of these skyscrapers, you couldn't see windows too far up more than just a
few floors, but we did have men in the middle of the block, but they weren't
instructed to watch the windows as much as they were to watch the people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did these men actually have any specific instructions as to how
they were to go about watching the people or the windows?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. We had experienced detectives down there in the immediate
block watching in the crowd and then we had some reservists, too, and we had
instructed our people in the course of training that when somebody comes by,
that you are supposed to secure, that you are not supposed to watch that
person, but supposed to watch the crowd.</p>

<p>Whether all of them remember this or not&mdash;when you don't get a President
here but every number of years, why you don't know. That is the reason I
think that in some places where they have these kind of people frequently,
this is probably routine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have men stationed in the neighborhood of Elm and
Houston and the School Book Depository that were instructed to be watching
the crowds?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No, sir; I don't think anyone was stationed below Houston
Street. At that point, I don't know whether any crowd along that particular
point was even anticipated or not. It was away from the business section and
it was not any buildings on either side of the street there, actually.</p>

<p>The School Book Depository faces on Elm Street, which is parallel to the
Elm Street ramp that goes under the triple underpass.</p>

<p>It is a couple of hundred feet across from the street to that Building and
there wasn't anybody placed down there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don't recall that there was a police car stationed either
along Elm Street or Houston near that intersection?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. There was a police car that preceded the two of them,
as a matter of fact, that preceded the Presidential convoy. One was a quarter of
a mile ahead and one was back of that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am referring to a stationary car at the intersection.</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. No; there wasn't one, that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay, I think that is it.</p>

<h2 id="ACC">TESTIMONY OF ASSISTANT CHIEF CHARLES BATCHELOR RESUMED</h2>

<p>The testimony of Assistant Chief Charles Batchelor was taken at 12:30 p.m., on
April 1, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan
and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Chief Batchelor, I think that you made a deposition before Burt
Griffin, a member of the advisory staff of the President's Commission, now on
March 23, 1964, is that not a fact, sir?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think also that you have now read the transcript of that deposition
and that you have made certain corrections of typographical errors in
pen and ink and by initialing those. You advise me now that you are willing to
sign the deposition except that there are two statements, one on page 199,
and one on page 219, that you wish to clarify, or change; is that correct?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now chief, are you willing to consider this deposition as a continuation
of the deposition taken by Mr. Griffin on the 23d?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you willing also to waive any notices that you would be
entitled to before we begin this continuation of the deposition?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you consider yourself to be under the same oath that you
were at the time you made the deposition before Mr. Griffin?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Now, I understand that you wish to comment,
or change the following: On page 199, lines 9 and 10 read as follows:</p>

<p>"Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. You are arguing with me. I had nothing to do with moving
the prisoner."</p>

<p>Now, Chief, what do you say about what I have just read?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. That statement was inadvertently incorrect. I wished to
say that I had nothing to do with changing the plans of moving the prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now turning to page 219, we find that lines 11 through 14 read
as follows, to wit:</p>

<p>"I don't know how you would correct this exactly. 'One of the problems that
we experienced was the fact that such, of such a short time to do some of
planning that we did'".</p>

<p>Do you wish to make a comment about that statement, sir?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. I don't recall the exact language I used in the statement,
but the sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should read:</p>

<p>"One of the problems that we experienced was the fact that we had such a
short time to do some of the planning that we had to do."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than that, Chief, have you found that the transcription of
your deposition is correct?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Then, when these notes concerning the corrections
have been typed out I think you will be in a position to sign the original
deposition, now, making a notation that you signed it approving all except such
as has been corrected this morning?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you will also sign the second deposition, as it were,
which is this morning's deposition?</p>

<p>Chief <span class="smcap">Batchelor</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your present occupation, Chief?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Chief of Police, Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long have you been occupying that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Since January 20, 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas Police Department
altogether?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Since May 1, 1936.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how did you begin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I began, I believe, as a traffic police officer&mdash;well, I worked in a
squad car a few days as a patrolman, and then worked as a traffic officer for
several months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old were you when you began?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Twenty-three&mdash;I lacked a few months being twenty-three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What education have you, Chief?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I graduated from the Dallas high schools&mdash;Dallas Technical High
School. I did not go to college. I studied a short time&mdash;optometry a short time
after that, after graduating from high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What employment did you have between leaving high school and
joining the police force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I worked a short time for Vitalic Battery Co., as I recall, and
at the time I entered the police field, I owned a small cleaning and pressing
shop out in East Dallas, which I owned and operated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have a family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state who they are, how many children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I have three step-children&mdash;no, it's two step-children, one son of
my own and one daughter of my own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I take it that you're practically a lifetime resident of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; I moved here when I was less than a year old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It appears to me from what you have said that you began at
the bottom of the ranks in the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And would it be fair to say that you worked your way through,
as it were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Up the line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, sir; I worked in practically every assignment the police department
has, and through civil service examinations was able to gain promotions
to a detective, sergeant, lieutenant of police, captain of police, inspector
of police, and inspector of police is the highest civil service rank obtainable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you attain that rank, Mr. Curry, roughly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I believe it was about 1951, along about that as inspector&mdash;I don't
recall exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does the obtaining of that rank in the civil service system involve
special studies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Well, you must make some special studies in order to compete
with the other men who are trying to reach promotion through examination.
During these years I won a fellowship to Northwestern University Traffic
Institute and attended that school in 1945&ndash;46. I graduated from there. In
1951 I was sent to the FBI National Academy in Washington, D.C., and I
graduated from that school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wish you would tell us other schools or training sessions you
have attended.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Well, I've been to several schools conducted in the Dallas area.
I have been to 2 weeks training school by the department of public safety
in Austin. I have been to several schools conducted by Southern Methodist
University and the FBI here in the Dallas area through the years. I have
also taken correspondence training courses from the City Managers' Association,
and I believe that's about the extent of my training.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you in service during the war, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I was in what was called the CPA, Civilian Pilot Training. It
was a program that was open to people who were over combat age&mdash;in the Air
Force. We did not receive any pay when we first went in. We volunteered
our services and we were taught to fly. We attended ground training school;
I was assigned to Gainesville Junior College and flew out of Gainesville, out
of the airfield there. I was then sent to TCU in Fort Worth where I continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
my studies at TCU and flew out of Meacham Field, and then I was sent to
Amarillo Air Force Base. We were not on the base, but we were assigned in
that area and we waited there for, it seemed to me like 2 or 3 weeks and never
received any training. We were then notified that we had an opportunity to
either ask for release or discharge from the service because we understood&mdash;because
of an oversupply of pilots, or else to remain in the program and be
sent to various branches of the Air Force for various assignments.</p>

<p>At that time, I, along with my buddy whose father advised us that he thought
it was best for us to get out&mdash;we applied for a discharge, and I was discharged,
so I was in this about 11 months, at which time I was discharged and I returned
to Dallas and I reported back to my draft board, and that's the last contact
that I had with my draft board.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you went back to your duties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I went back to my duties as police officer. I was assigned as a
detective at the time, and I worked for undercover a few months; I was then
assigned as a sergeant in the traffic division; promoted to lieutenant of the
traffic division; subsequently promoted to captain of the traffic division. I was
then assigned to a police training school. I attended the FBI school then.</p>

<p>Upon my return from the FBI school, I completed an examination for promotion
to inspector of police and was able to obtain the No. 1 position and was
promoted to inspector of police, and assigned to the police training school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that examination and that promotion was civil service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Under the laws of Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And perhaps it would be better if you would just continue testifying&mdash;to
tell us the various stages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I was assigned to the various training schools, had charge of the
police training, and also personnel investigation. I was then appointed assistant
chief of police in charge, which assignment is actually the second in
command of the police department&mdash;that was in October of 1953.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that is a non-civil-service position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's an appointive job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who appointed you to that job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Well, the chief appointed me, I'm sure, on the approval of the
city manager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was the chief at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Carl F. Hansson [spelling], H-a-n-s-s-o-n.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I served in that capacity until Chief Hansson resigned, and at
that time I was appointed chief of police. I was appointed acting chief of
police in December and when his name was removed from the rolls in January
1960, I was appointed chief of police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He resigned voluntarily?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it because of old age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I don't know exactly why he resigned. He left us to go as executive
secretary of the Citizens Traffic Commission here in Dallas, and he served in
that capacity for some year or so and resigned from that capacity, and then he
went as chief of the Mesquite Police Department and remained there a year or
two and at the present time is in an advisory capacity at Richardson, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you were second in command at the time you were appointed
chief of police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you had been actually for some time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. About 7 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was the city manager who appointed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Elgin Crull, I believe he was at the time I was appointed. He
was when I was appointed chief of police, because I recall&mdash;I don't recall exactly
who was city manager at the time I was appointed assistant chief. I believe
Chuck Ford, I believe, was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, as you said, the assistant chief of police and the chief
of police, are non-civil service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you still maintain civil service status in the event of a
reduction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. In a reduction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. In rank; you are supposed to return to the rank where you were
when appointed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you, of course, as chief of police, have under you a number
of assistant and deputy chiefs of police and then captains of the various divisions
and so forth. Who made those appointments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. They are under civil service except for the assistant chief and
the deputy chiefs and I make those appointments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You made those appointments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes. Now, I didn't make all the appointments, because some of
them were in those positions when I was appointed chief. I appointed Batchelor
as assistant chief of police and I appointed Fisher, who is in charge of radio
patrol, as deputy chief of police, and I think the rest of them were in their
positions when I was made chief and I left them there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had the authority to move them, I take it, but you chose to
leave them there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, everybody else was in his position by virtue of
civil service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I would like to direct your attention to the time when the
Dallas Police Department first arrested Oswald, and, I assume, became responsible
for him and for his security. I believe that it was that he was arrested at
the Texas Theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And almost immediately moved to the Dallas Police Department
offices?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. So I understand; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us what you know about the matter from that point
on, and it may be just as well if you will tell it in a narrative fashion. I will
ask you some questions as we go along, or perhaps wait until the end to fill in.
We will see how it works out. Briefly, what we want to know is what you know
about the whole thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Well, on November 22, I was in the lead car of the Presidential
caravan. With me were Secret Service Winston Lawson and Forrest Sorrels,
and the sheriff of Dallas County, Bill Decker, and we were nearing the triple
underpass in the western part of Dallas, and which is near Stemmons Expressway&mdash;it
was necessary for us to move to Elm Street in order to get on the
Stemmons Expressway to get the President's caravan down to the Trade Mart
where they were going to have a luncheon.</p>

<p>I heard a sharp report. We were near the railroad yards at this time, and I
didn't know&mdash;I didn't know exactly where this report came from, whether it
was above us or where, but this was followed by two more reports, and at that
time I looked in my rear view mirror and I saw some commotion in the President's
caravan and realized that probably something was wrong, and it seemed to
be speeding up, and about this time a motorcycle officer, I believe it was Officer
Chaney rode up beside us and I asked if something happened back there and he
said, "Yes," and I said, "Has somebody been shot?" And he said, "I think so."</p>

<p>So, I then ordered him to take us to Parkland Hospital which was the nearest
hospital, so we took the President's caravan then to Parkland Hospital and they
were&mdash;the President, the Vice President and the Governor&mdash;were taken into the
hospital and I remained at the hospital for&mdash;oh&mdash;some hour or so.</p>

<p>At about 1:15 that day&mdash;this first incident occurred about 12:30 or so, and
about 1:15 I was notified that one of our officers had been shot, and a few
minutes later was told that he was dead on arrival at the hospital.</p>

<p>At that time we didn't know who shot him. I was just told it was in Oak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Cliff. I was still at the hospital at this time and I was told by some of the
Secret Service people, I don't recall who, to get my car ready and another car
ready to take the President&mdash;we were informed that President Kennedy had
expired&mdash;and we were asked to have two automobiles standing by to take President
Johnson to Love Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me stop you and ask you this: When you had the news of
the death of Tippit, or the shooting of Tippit, did you associate that in any way
with the President's assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No; I didn't at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir; go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. In a little while President Johnson came out, and some of his
aides, and got into my car and some of his other people came and got into another
vehicle driven by Inspector Putnam of the Dallas Police Department, and we
were instructed to go to Love Field, to get there by the nearest route with the
least amount of noise, but to go there as quickly as we could. So I drove to Love
Field and the President got out of the car with his group and went aboard the
Presidential plane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any idea about what time you left the hospital to
go to Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, perhaps you can arrive at it this way; you know the time
you arrived there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. It seemed we were there about 30 minutes at the hospital&mdash;30
minutes or so, and we probably got there a little after 12:30, so that would have
been around a little after 1:15, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was a little after 1:15 that you started to move to Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you know Jack Ruby prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had never seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. If I had ever seen him, I didn't know it. I might have seen him
but I didn't recognize him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, now, you know who Jack Ruby is; you have seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I have seen him in the courtroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us whether or not among any of the people that you
saw at the hospital anywhere, whether Jack Ruby was at the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. If he was, I didn't know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's what I'm asking&mdash;you didn't see the man that you now
know to be Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a reporter from the Washington, D.C., newspaper
who is called Seth Kantor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I believe he used to be in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I believe he was, and moved on to Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I don't recall who all I saw out there&mdash;I saw a number of people
out there. If I saw him, I don't recall it. I very easily could have seen him
out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it follows from what you said before, of course, that you
did not see Kantor with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, let's go back then to the point we left off, and that is to say&mdash;the
arrival at Love Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, sir; we arrived at Love Field with the President and his party
and they got out of the car and got on the plane.</p>

<p>I was informed by someone a little later that Judge Sarah Hughes was coming
out to swear in the President, to give him the oath of office, and we stood by
and when she arrived I escorted her onto the plane and into the presence of
the President and was there while she gave to him the oath of office. Immediately
after he was given the oath of office, as I recall it, the President said,
"Let's get out of here." And I left the plane with Judge Sarah Hughes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
returned to my car and in the meantime while we were at Love Field, Mrs.
Kennedy and some others came and they loaded the casket onto the plane and
she went into the plane. After I got off the plane, I talked to Mrs. Cabell and
to Mayor Cabell and I waited until the planes left Love Field, and then I went to
the city hall.</p>

<p>Now, as best I recall, it was probably around 4 o'clock when I got to the city
hall, and I started to my office on the third floor, and when I got off of the
elevator there I could see that there was just pandemonium on the third floor.
There was dozens and dozens of newsmen just crammed into the north end of
the corridor. There were television cables running from down the halls, from
the administrative office, and I went to my office and talked with some of my
staff&mdash;I don't recall who all was in there at the time&mdash;about what was going
on, and I was told by someone, I believe Chief Stevenson that they had a man
named Oswald whom they believed to be the murderer of Officer Tippit, and they
had been questioning him in Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they advise you at that time, or did they know to your
knowledge that he was also a suspect in regard to the assassination of President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Someone mentioned that he was also a strong suspect in the
assassination of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was at that same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you got back there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. After I returned from Love Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you say Captain Fritz was carrying on the interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; that's his responsibility, to investigate murders, robberies,
and rapes, and extortions and things of that kind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It's fair to say, then, that the interrogation of Oswald with
respect to either the death of Tippit or of President Kennedy was in accordance
with the normal procedures of the department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had Captain Fritz been in that position, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. A number of years&mdash;I don't recall exactly when he was appointed
to his position with the homicide division&mdash;probably 15 years anyway.</p>

<p>I had received a call from the FBI or someone in the FBI, I don't recall
whether it was Shanklin or who, and they were requesting that a representative
of their Bureau be allowed to be present when Oswald was interviewed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you agree to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I called Fritz in his office and told him we had this request, and
Fritz said, "Okay; we'll let them in."</p>

<p>At that time I understood there was a representative from Secret Service
already in the room and the representative from the FBI went in&mdash;one or two
FBI representatives.</p>

<p>It was some time before I ever went to the homicide office myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you receive any message around that time or a little later
relayed to you as it were, through FBI agents, that Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, the
head of the FBI, wanted you to know of his concern about Oswald's security?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Specifically, I don't remember anyone coming to me and telling
me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, let's see&mdash;I think the last statement you made was that
it was sometime before you actually went to Fritz' office yourself. Is there
anything that happened of significance or that you want to put in the record
with reference to what happened between the time you got there around a little
after 4 and the time you did get in to see Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir; I wasn't particularly interested in seeing him or interfering
with the investigation in any way. I stayed up in the administrative
offices most of the time. I had a number of calls from various people, I don't
recall just who all I talked to. I conferred with some of my staff during that
time and I was kept informed of the progress of the investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How were you kept informed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Usually through Chief Stevenson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you would move from Captain Fritz' <span class="locked">office&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Either by telephone or go down to the office and talk to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Well, nothing of significance that I can recall occurred. Later
in the evening someone told me that they had enough evidence that he had
been identified as the slayer of our police officer.</p>

<p>Captain Fritz thought he had better go ahead and file on him and I think
it was about 7:30 on the day they did file on him, and I think he had been
down&mdash;had been to the showup a time or two&mdash;there were some witnesses who
had identified him, so I was told, as being the man who shot Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Oswald then, or when was the first time you saw
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I don't recall exactly the first time I saw him, but I believe it
was in the evening&mdash;in the early evening. When I did see him I remember
that he impressed me as being a sullen, arrogant individual, and he didn't
seem particularly perturbed with the fact that he was being interrogated or
that he was causing such a commotion&mdash;he was pretty cool.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't question him yourself, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, he was filed upon about 7:30 with respect to Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Somewhere around in there&mdash;I don't know exactly when it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Then, after he was filed on for this offense, I believe it was
Captain Fritz who told me that they were working now on the possibility
that he was the same suspect or the assassin of the President, and they began
to, when I say "they" I mean Captain Fritz, principally, told me of some of
the evidence that was piling up against him. In fact, he told me that he
worked in this Building and that that morning he had carried a package into
the Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This information was being relayed to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Relayed to me by Fritz&mdash;just summing up what they found out
about him. He told me that, as I recall, he told me that Oswald had been in
the Building on this day and that one of the Negro porters had seen him go to
the sixth floor, I believe, at lunch time, and that after the shooting, some of our
officers went into the Building and they saw Oswald at a lunch counter or in the
recreation room and started to approach him or question him and they were
told by Mr. Truly, who is the Building manager, that this was one of their
employees, and I think the officer passed him on up and went on upstairs to try
to determine where these shots came from.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I believe Inspector Sawyer was several blocks away from
there, from that location, and when he heard what was happening, he immediately
went to the location to take over all security and searching there.</p>

<p>Chief Lumpkin and some of his party went on to Love Field with me and they
went back to the Texas School Book Depository. So, several minutes elapsed
from the time of the shooting until anyone could have gotten&mdash;any officers
could have gotten actually to the Building.</p>

<p>As soon as it was feasible or possible, they did seal off this Building and
also that they had checked all of the employees of the Building and found out
that there was one missing, and I think this is when they suspected him of being
involved in the fatal shooting of the President, and from the description, I believe
they began to tie the two suspects together&mdash;the suspect of the shooting of the
officer, and all this was told to me by people of the homicide bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, when we last talked about Oswald, I think it was when
he was being charged with respect to Tippit, and then I gather that the information
you are giving us now is the background for charging him as the
assassin of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were aware of that too&mdash;you were still in the Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall a meeting&mdash;it has sometimes been called a showup
or a lineup&mdash;I don't know that that is accurate, but it took place in the assembly
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. And some of the members of the press were there, yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, can you tell us what that was about? About what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I don't recall exactly the time it was&mdash;it was in the evening, sometime
after they had interrogated, I think, Oswald. I think he had been in the
showup once or twice previous to this for witnesses to observe him, and there
were so many newsmen in the halls that they were not all of them able to see
or to get any pictures or any thing else in the north corridor of the third floor,
and some of them asked me to&mdash;sometime during the evening&mdash;when they could
see Oswald, how does he look, can we see him?</p>

<p>At this time Henry Wade, the district attorney, was up there and Alexander
was up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He is the assistant district attorney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; and something was said about&mdash;how about letting us see him
or could we see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was said by Wade or Alexander or by the newsmen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. By the newsmen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the presence of Wade and Alexander?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; as I recall it, I asked Henry Wade, "Do you see anything
wrong with it," and as I recall, he told me, "Not that I know of, I don't see
anything wrong with it." And, so, we told them if they would go to the assembly
room that we would let them see Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is the assembly room located on another floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, in the basement; we were on the third floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the assembly room is in effect&mdash;it is a room, as I recall it,
that might seat 50 or 75 people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it has a little stage with the usual showup apparatus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, there is gauze in front of the prisoners, so
that the audience can see them, but the prisoners can't look out. And there
are markings on it as to height and their numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's the room we are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, that's the room he was taken to. He was not put on the
stage, he was just put in front of the stage for the showup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, he was not put behind the gauze?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Not this time, I think he was on previous occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; when there was a real lineup for identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But this was not an identification lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No; it was the news media clamoring to see him, and they wanted
to know when they could look at him or when they could observe him, and on
the third floor when he was brought to and from the interrogation room, which
was Captain Fritz' office, they had to go about 20 or 25 feet, and they almost
mobbed him every time they would bring him through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are saying they had to go about 20 or 25 feet to get to the
elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the inside elevator, not the public elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It's the inside <span class="locked">elevator&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. The prisoners' elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That leads all of the police department down into the basement
into the jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir; go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. So, we warned them not to try to interfere with him or anything
else and we would let them see him. We did take him down and let them
briefly see him&mdash;this was just a very short time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you present then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who else was present, among the police officers you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I don't recall&mdash;I think Fritz was&mdash;I don't know that he was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
the room, and there was a couple of detectives who brought the suspect in. Henry
Wade and Alexander were in the vicinity&mdash;they were not right there with me,
so when we brought him in, the news media started then to trying to talk to him
and he was only there for a few seconds and we removed him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see, during the time you were in the assembly room that
you have just been speaking about, the man you now know as Jack Ruby in that
room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir; I didn't. I understood he was there, but I didn't see him,
and would not have known him had I seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, that's correct, but now that you do know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I didn't recognize him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't recognize him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your present memory doesn't associate the man you now know as
Jack Ruby with being in that room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, can you tell us why Oswald was moved for the purpose of
charging him in the case of Tippit, and subsequently in the case of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I don't know in the case of Tippit. I wasn't there. I mean, I
wasn't present when he was charged, but he was charged with the murder of
the President&mdash;he was charged in the lobby of the identification bureau, which is
on the fourth floor of the police department, and he was brought out of the jail
into the identification bureau and the charge was read to him by Judge David
Johnston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am trying to get at is what security measures were observed
with reference to him during the time that he was moved through these
crowds of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Officers surrounded him. We had officers in front and in the
back and by the side of him as he was moving&mdash;usually two detectives, two or
three uniformed officers, when he moved through the crowds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand you said that there was a huge crowd on the third
floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I would take it that there was a rather large crowd in the
assembly room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; there were several&mdash;a good many there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to say that other than on the third floor, when he was
being moved and when he was in the assembly room, he was not exposed in
any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No; he was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, there were no persons around him but police then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when he was moved through the hall, however many times
he was at the third floor&mdash;of course, you had this mob of newsmen and there
were a group of newsmen in the assembly room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am getting at&mdash;what security measures were taken, if
you know, with respect to who was in that crowd of newsmen of the people in
the assembly room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I don't know, other than on the third floor. I know that there
was some police reservists and a police sergeant who was screening people who
came up on the third floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, how would they screen them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. As they got off of the elevator, I would observe that they would
check them, apparently asking for identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The elevator would be the only way to get up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. The stairway, they could get up the stairway. The officers were
so located that had someone come up the stairway they would have seen them
too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the officers checking the elevator could also check
the staircase?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether any instructions had been given to those
officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I don't know of my knowledge, but I observed them checking the
people who came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whose responsibility would it have been to post those officers
for the purpose of checking there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Usually the captain on duty in that building&mdash;that would have
been Captain Talbert, I believe, but it could have been someone else. Had they
observed the need for it, they could have issued orders to get someone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Obviously, someone must have posted two men there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say you have in the department any standard operative
procedures to cover a situation like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Not exactly this type incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, in any case, you observed that that was a security check
going on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is the same thing approximately true about the group that was
in the assembly room when Oswald was brought down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Well, now, I don't know that they were all checked as they went
into the assembly room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you give any instructions about the security of Oswald
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No; I just told them to keep the newsmen&mdash;and I told the newsmen
they would have to stay back inside the confines of the room and not approach
the prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me put it this way&mdash;generally speaking, did you give any
specific instructions regarding the security of Oswald, during that period we are
talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, not this period&mdash;no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what system of checking for identification was
being used by the officers on the third floor guarding the elevator and staircase?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I don't know of my own knowledge. I could see them checking
the people to see whether they were up to do police business or whether they
were newsmen trying to cover the incident. We were carrying on the normal
business we would conduct, and this would bring a great many people to the
third floor, relatives of prisoners, complainants, various people that would
come to the other bureaus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Normally, there would be no police checking those two elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that, I suppose it is fair to state, isn't it, that the main function
of that check was to keep curiosity seekers out of the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right&mdash;that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And to check also to see if anybody had any legitimate business
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I think we can just continue on then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Well, after Oswald was arraigned, I went back to my office&mdash;I
went home a little while after that and that was, I believe, Saturday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; that would be Friday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; Friday night, yes; and Saturday morning I came down to
the office and I don't remember any particular outstanding incident that occurred
during the day. It was a rather routine investigation&mdash;there continued the
investigation from the homicide division section on the murder of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the crowd of newspapermen still there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, sir; they stayed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were the security measures you have described still in force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, sir; they stayed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was neither more nor less?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. It was about the same. I had several conferences during the day
with various staff members and I was kept informed of the progress of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
investigation. Late that evening, the different members of the press, news
media, began to ask me when we were going to transfer Oswald because he had
been filed on, and I told them I didn't know, that this was something that
would be left up to Captain Fritz because he was conducting the investigation
and the interrogation, and usually he would be the one to determine when he
was ready to transfer the prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When a prisoner is formally charged, as Oswald had been, what
is the normal procedure to transfer the prisoner to the State prison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. There are two ways it is done. Sometimes the bureau transfers
the person to the sheriff's office, and sometimes the sheriff's office sends up and
gets them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And either type is usual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Either one is acceptable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had Decker made any request to you to deliver what, in effect,
was his prisoner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Not at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, on Saturday night, that would be the 23d, you were asked,
I think, by the newsmen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. When we were going to transfer him and I told them I didn't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; go on from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. And some of them asked if "They are going to transfer him tonight?"
And I said, "I don't think so." Then, I talked to Fritz about when he
thought he would transfer the prisoner, and he didn't think it was a good idea
to transfer him at night because of the fact you couldn't see, and if anybody
tried to cause them any trouble, they needed to see who they were and where it
was coming from and so forth, and he suggested that we wait until daylight,
so this was normal procedure, I mean, for Fritz to determine when he is going
to transfer his prisoners, so I told him, "Okay." I asked him, I said, "What
time do you think you will be ready tomorrow?" And he didn't know exactly
and I said, "Do you think about 10 o'clock," and he said, "I believe so," and
then is when I went out and told the newspaper people, the news media that
we were not going to transfer him that night and some of them asked, "When
should we be back, when are you going to transfer him?" And I said, "I don't
know," because I didn't know when we were going to transfer him. Some
of them said, "When should we back?" I made the remark then, "I believe
if you are back here by 10 o'clock you will be back in time to observe anything
you care to observe."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us whether on Saturday night any plans had been
made for the transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Not on Saturday night, I don't believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, you went home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, let's pick up with the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. On Sunday morning, I came down to the office, and, as I recall,
it was probably 8:30 or 8:45 when I got to the office, and as I parked my car
in the basement of the city hall and started up to our office, I noticed that a
large camera had been set up out in the hallway between the jail office and
the end of the corridor immediately in front of the jail office, and it was in the
way of traffic, and Lieutenant Wiggins came out and I told him&mdash;I told Lieutenant
Wiggins, I said, "You are going to have to move this camera out of
here," and then I told Wiggins, I said, "Now, if the news media come down
here and want in, put them over behind the rail." There is a rail separating
the ramp that comes down in the basement from the parking area. There
were two cars in there, I believe a patrol wagon and a squad car and I told him
to move those vehicles out and if the news media came down and wanted to
observe from the basement, that they were to be placed back over in this area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to state, then, that in your own mind, you had determined
that the way to move him was through the basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes. I believe about this&mdash;Chief Stevenson and Chief Batchelor
approached me&mdash;I think they had been there earlier, and I told them I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the best thing to do was to set up our security down there and bring Oswald
down there and transfer him on to the county jail.</p>

<p>I went on up to the office and Chief Batchelor and Chief Stevenson, I think,
remained in the basement a while and Captain Talbert was down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you delegate to any specific person the security of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir; I could see that he was being taken care of by the captain
on duty, Captain Talbert, and Lieutenant Wiggins was assisting in it,
so I didn't see any need to particularly call some officer over there and say, "Look,
you are in charge of this security in this basement." It was being taken care
of, I could see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, for the record, will you tell us what you saw that satisfied
you that it was being taken care of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Officers were being stationed at the strategic points in the basement
to screen people coming in, and they were moving out the vehicles as I
asked them to, so I went on upstairs and I told Chief Batchelor and Chief
Stevenson that we should clean out everything in the basement and screen
everything that came back in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you ordered everything to be "screened" did you give any
specific instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No; I didn't</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or does that term have any significance in police work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Well, it means to satisfy yourself that they were people who
had a legitimate reason to be there when you screen them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, within the organization of the police department,
the word "screening" is understood so that you were satisfied that there would
not be people there who were not supposed to be there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Any unauthorized people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just one more point on that&mdash;under the system, who would be
considered as unauthorized persons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I think I specifically stated that only newspaper reporters or police
officers would be allowed in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Only the news media?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Television people&mdash;would be included, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any discussion of the route to be taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; let's go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Then, I went on upstairs and a little while later I went to Fritz'
office and they were interrogating him&mdash;they&mdash;there were several people in there,
some I recognized as FBI agents, some were Secret Service agents, some were
Dallas detectives, and Captain Fritz was talking to Oswald at the time, I believe,
and I stood around a few moments and when there was a lull in the interrogation,
I asked Captain Fritz if he was about ready to transfer Oswald and he said,
"Well, no; they were still talking to him," so I left the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. As I recall, it was probably 10:30, but I didn't care when they
transferred him at all. It didn't make any difference to me. The arrangements
had been made to transfer him and then when it was brought <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What arrangements had been made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That we would transfer him to the sheriff, but at that time we
did not have any armored cars down there. We were just at that time, I believe
it was&mdash;understood that we would just put him in the car and drive him
down there.</p>

<p>Someone asked me if I had heard of the threats that had been made against
him, and I had. They had called me at home about it, and I called Sheriff
Decker, I think, from Fritz' office, and when Fritz said they were ready to transfer
the man, and this is something after 11 o'clock&mdash;probably a little after 11,
and Decker said, "Okay, bring him on," and at that time I said, "I thought you
were coming after him."</p>

<p>Decker said, "Either way, I'll come after him or you can bring him to me,"
and I thought since we had so much involved here, we were the ones that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
investigating the case and we had the officers set up downstairs to handle it,
so I told Decker&mdash;I said, "Okay, we'll bring him to you."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, at first your security precaution in the basement
was to take care of the situation of either your having to move him from the jail
or Decker coming after him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Or Decker coming after him; that's right. Then, I saw Chief
Batchelor, and I believe, Chief Stevenson, and we discussed the threats that
we had had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that was, of course, after you had heard about the threats
and after you had talked to Decker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think you mentioned you talked to Decker a little after
11 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Well, it was probably before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wanted to bring that to your attention because it seems to
me it must have been earlier than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; it was. Because we had to get the armored car in there after
that. Anyway, after it was determined we would move him, Chief Batchelor,
I believe, and Chief Stevenson and myself discussed this security and we decided
it would be best to get an armored car down there in the event some one, some
group tried to take our prisoner away from us, it would be better to have him
in an armored car.</p>

<p>So. Chief Batchelor called the man, I don't recall his name now, that runs
the armored motor service here in Dallas, and requested that we be furnished
with an armored car, and I was told later that they had two sizes, an overland
truck and a city truck and they would send them both over there when they
could get the drivers and we could use whichever one we wanted.</p>

<p>Well, as I understand it, during this time the questioning of Oswald continued
up in Captain Fritz' office, and I believe it was about a quarter to 11 or around
11 when we were told the armored cars were there and they backed them into
the basement and they wouldn't go all the way down because of the height of
the vehicle, and one of them was parked on the ramp and officers were placed
on each side of it. In the meantime, I understand that the basement had been
completely cleaned out of any unauthorized persons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell me why it was that the Commerce Street exit was
chosen to put the armored car in and for the cars carrying Oswald to leave in,
rather than the Main Street exit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Because Commerce Street is one way east and all the traffic
comes in on Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Main Street is two-way traffic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. It is two-way traffic and the exit is one way east, so the vehicles
were placed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of geographical fact, except for the fact that you
would have been going the wrong way, up the Main Street ramp and that you
had two-way traffic on Main Street, the actual closest route would have been
to go up the Main Street ramp, turn left up Main Street and go down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; it would. It would have been about three or four blocks
closer, because when we came out of Commerce you had to go east to the
second block and make a turn one block and make a turn back west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Chief, have you any comment to make as to why the longer
route instead of the shorter route was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Well, just because ordinarily we don't violate traffic rules and
regulations in the transfer of prisoners and we thought this was the normal
route that should be taken and that's the reason it was set up that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The original decision, as I remember it, was to go through the
Commerce Street exit and then turn left up to North Central?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then turn left again and go to Elm and then go on down
to the county jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. When I went back up into the homicide office and told Fritz
about our plans of transferring the prisoner, he was not particularly pleased
with the idea of putting the prisoner in the armored car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. He said if someone tried to take our prisoner, he felt like we
ought to be able to maneuver and he felt that this would be too awkward in
in this heavy armored car and he preferred that the prisoner be transferred
in a regular police car with detectives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was a policeman to drive the armored car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No; not the armored car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a factor, too&mdash;I suppose&mdash;it wouldn't be a member of
the police force under your control driving that car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No; but he felt like&mdash;Fritz said if anyone tried to take our
prisoner we should be in a position to be able to cut out of the caravan or
to take off or do whatever was necessary to protect our prisoner.</p>

<p>So, I didn't argue with him about it&mdash;there was some merit to his plan, so
I told him, "Well, okay, but we would still use the armored car as a decoy and
let it go right on down just as we had planned and if anyone planned to try
to take our prisoner away from us, they would be attacking an empty armored
car," and that his vehicle with the prisoner in it would have cut out of the
caravan and proceeded immediately to the county jail and the prisoner would
be taken into the county jail, and the way we figured it, he would be there
before the other caravan got there.</p>

<p>Well, he asked me if everything was ready and I said, "Yes, as far as I know,
everything is ready to go," and this was a little after 11 o'clock and I said,
"Well, I'll go on down to the basement," and was en route to the basement
when I was called to the telephone and Mayor Cabell was on the telephone
wanting to know something about the case, how we were progressing, what was
going on, and while I was talking to him they made this transfer and Oswald
was shot in the basement, and he was rushed to Parkland Hospital and I was
notified that he had been shot in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know about his being shot before he moved to the
hospital in the ambulance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, they called me from the jail office and said he had been shot
and an ambulance had been ordered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, after the shooting, what action did you take&mdash;that is, the
shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Well, I don't recall any particular action I took. I was told
the man who shot him was in custody and was up in the jail. I think I notified
the mayor that the man had been shot while I was still on the telephone with
him and then I waited up in my office for word from Parkland Hospital,
and about 1:30, or I believe about 1:30, we were informed that he had expired,
and during this time I had been informed that the man who shot him was a
nightclub operator named Jack Ruby, and that he was in custody up in the jail.</p>

<p>After I was informed that Oswald had died, I made an announcement to
news media that he had expired and that we had the man who shot him in
custody and as I recall, that's about the extent of my activity on that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember whether on Sunday, November 24, it came
to your attention that Ruby had stated that he entered the jail through the
Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I heard that, but I don't know who told it to me. I just heard
a rumor that he had come in through the Main Street ramp. I understood that
he told some more people that up in the jail.</p>

<p>After this happened, I immediately set up an investigative team to try to
find out what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you say "immediately," you mean on the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Inspector Sawyer, Capt. O.&nbsp;A. Jones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were your instructions to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. To interrogate everyone that had anything to do with this and
find out what they knew about it, what had happened and how and why and
how it occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to state that your instructions were then to find out
exactly the truth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you did receive a report from them ultimately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I take it, of course, that you studied it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I remember the report, it made certain specific findings as
to how Ruby entered and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes, according to the report he did come down the Main Street
ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From your study of the report and all the statements that you got,
are you satisfied with the conclusions reached in the report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I believe this is the way he came in. I don't believe the officer
at the top of the ramp where he came in, I don't believe that he knew that he
went by, but I do state this, that I think the proper security was set up, and
that had each officer carried out his assignment, I believe the transfer would
have been made safely, and while I, as head of the department, have to accept
responsibility for the security, I can say this, that the proper security was set up.</p>

<p>It was a failure of one man to carry out his assignment properly that permitted
this man, apparently, to come into the basement of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that man you mean is Roy Vaughn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Vaughn&mdash;Officer Vaughn, the officer assigned to the Main Street
ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any kind of influence of any sort whatsoever or
suggestions exercised upon you or made to you concerning the transfer of
Oswald by either Mayor Cabell or City Manager Crull?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir; they left it up to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Chief, as you know, there has been some suggestion that a
desire to satisfy the press dictated the time of the movement and the route.
I think you ought to have an opportunity at this time to recall your own observations
as to what influence, if any, considerations of pleasing the press entered
into any of these plans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Well, I would only say this, that we were trying in the police
department to let the press have an opportunity to observe the proceedings as
they were. This is an event that had not been&mdash;the like of the event had not
been seen or heard, I think, in this century.</p>

<p>I didn't have any particular ones to come to me and insist that this be done
in this manner. I saw no particular harm in allowing the media to observe
the prisoner, and with no laws against it, and no policies that had ever been
set up stating that the news media would not be allowed to see a prisoner.</p>

<p>There was no way for us to take the prisoner from the homicide office to the
jail and back without the news media seeing him. I was besieged actually
by the press to permit them to see Oswald. They made such remarks as, "The
public has a right to see, to know," I didn't want them to think that we were
mistreating Oswald; that we were carrying on this investigation in a normal
manner, and that this case was handled as probably any other case would have
been handled, although this had more national appeal, you might say, and
had some curiosity to it, than some of the other cases we have handled.</p>

<p>But certainly the fact that the news media was permitted to see him and to
take pictures of him was not anything unusual. This has always been done,
but not to this extent because we didn't have this much press present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand what you are saying, it is that had it not been
for the fact that the victim was Oswald, if it was Oswald, and it was the
President involved, this would have been quite normal procedure, that is to say,
the press would have been allowed to see him, you would have told them when
he was going to be moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And allowed them to take pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was any suggestion made to you by anybody that it would
be best to disregard those considerations with respect to the press and use
another route in making the transfer at another time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir; not that I recall. Fritz and I, I think, discussed this
briefly, the possibility of getting that prisoner out of the city hall during the
night hours and by another route and slipping him to the jail, but actually Fritz
was not too much in favor of this and I more or less left this up to Fritz as to
when and how this transfer would be made, because he has in the past transferred
many of his prisoners to the county jail and I felt that since it was his
responsibility, the prisoner was, to let him decide when and how he wanted
to transfer this prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you didn't, in any case, give him instructions not to
transfer the prisoner at a time when he could not be observed by the press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to state that had he done so, it would have been satisfactory
to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I would not have complained about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether Fritz' decision not to move him prior
to the time that had been announced to the press was motivated by considerations
of the press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I don't know whether it was or not. I think this&mdash;that he didn't
know how long he would be interrogating. I don't believe Fritz wanted to
move him at night. I think he wanted to move him in the daytime so that
he could see anyone that might be trying to cause him any trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your thought is that, therefore, Fritz' decision not to move
him at night was dictated by considerations of security?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Chief, I believe that I ought to offer you the opportunity to
state for the record here as an overall proposition what you consider to be
the cause of what was obviously a security breakdown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. I think the cause of the breakdown was the fact that Officer
Vaughn left his post to assist this Lieutenant Pierce, and I believe Sergeant
Dean, and I don't know who else was in the car, as they left the basement of
the city hall going the wrong way on the ramp, and Officer Vaughn stepped
across the sidewalk which he had been instructed, so I am told, to guard that
ramp&mdash;to let only police officers or bona fide news media enter there. He
momentarily stepped away from his assignment and while he was away from
this assignment, our investigation shows that Jack Ruby went behind him and
entered the ramp and went to the bottom of the ramp and stood behind some
detectives and news media.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Concerning the security at the top of the Main Street ramp where
Vaughn was, what observations have you to make about that means of entry
being guarded by one man only instead of, say, more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Well, actually, this seemed to be the least risk in our security
plan. All of the crowd and vehicles and everything was over on Commerce
Street and there was very little over on Main Street, actually very little activity
at all. It was only about a 12-foot ramp there that he had to guard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he was standing right in the middle of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Had he stayed on his assignment, I don't see how Ruby could
have gotten in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, when the Pierce car came up, he obviously had to
move away, but your thought is he moved too far away from his assignment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. He moved too far away from his assignment. He apparently
was assisting this vehicle to get across the sidewalk, I think it was 10 or 12
feet wide, and into the street. Actually, he should have just stepped to one
side and let the vehicle come by.</p>

<p>Now, this officer was put on a polygraph to determine whether or not he
knew that Ruby went by him and according to the test, the results of the test,
he did not realize that Ruby went by him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Chief, in addition to your testimony, I have shown you two
documents which I think you have read, and I am marking for identification
as follows, to-wit: The first one is a report of an interview of you by FBI Agent
Vincent Drain on November 25, the document consisting of two pages, and I
am marking on the first page "Dallas, Tex., April 15, 1964, Exhibit 5313, deposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
of Chief J.&nbsp;E. Curry," and I am signing my name on that, and on the second
page I am placing my initials.</p>

<p>With respect to the second document, it seems to be a copy of an interview
of you made by FBI Agent Leo Robertson on December 10, 1963, and I am
marking on the margin of the first page, as follows: "Dallas, Tex., April 15,
1964, Exhibit 5314, deposition of Chief J.&nbsp;E. Curry," and I am signing my
name at the bottom of that page, and since the document has a second page,
I am placing my initials at the bottom of the second page.</p>

<p>Now, I am going to ask you if you would mind signing your name where
my name appears and your initials where my initials are, so that the record
will show we both are talking about the same document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>(Signed document as requested by Counsel Hubert.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then I am going to ask you whether you have any comments
to make about those two documents? Would you initial the second page, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; I will.</p>

<p>(Witness Curry initialed instruments as requested by Counsel Hubert.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Chief, have you had an opportunity to read both of those
documents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; I looked them over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do they represent the truth so far as you know of the interviews
that they purport to cover?</p>

<p>Now, if you have any comments to make or deletions or modifications or
changes, or if you find that those documents are incorrect, I would like for you
to say so, because what we will have to do is to get into the record what is
correct and not what is not correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. [Examining instruments as referred to.] Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are they correct, sir? Do you have any comments or deletions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No; I don't have any comments. As far as I know&mdash;as far as I
can recall, this is about what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, have you ever been interviewed by any member of the
Commission's staff prior to this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir; I had a little conversation with you over in my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was about 2 weeks ago when I was present in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there anything that occurred during that conversation that
has not been covered here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, finally, is there anything at all you would like to make a
matter of record concerning this whole thing? You are at liberty to say anything
you want to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No; the only thing I would like to say is that I deeply regret the
incidents that occurred and I feel like we did everything that could be expected
of us as a police department to set up the security of the President and to cooperate
with all agencies that had a responsibility in this matter, that we certainly
would have liked for Oswald to have remained alive and faced trial.</p>

<p>According to the information that was given to me by the homicide bureau, we
had developed a very good case on him and would have been able to, I'm sure,
would have been able to convict him in a court of law.</p>

<p>Jack Ruby&mdash;I do not know, I did not know. It has been intimated that a great
many of the Dallas police officers did know him, but from what I've been able
to find out, there were some police officers who knew him, but most of them knew
him because of the fact they had conducted police business with him at his place
of business. There were a few, perhaps, that knew him and had gone to his
place of business for social activities, but it was certainly not&mdash;he is not known
by the majority of the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Chief, perhaps you would like to comment on two things&mdash;one, is
that, as you know, there has been some talk or rumor, of course, that the police
department cooperated, or some members of it, with Ruby for an opportunity for
Ruby to shoot Oswald.</p>

<p>Have you looked into that, and if you have, would you give us your observations
about it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. My instructions to the investigating officers were to go into every
facet of this incident and to uncover any information that might indicate that
any police officer cooperated in any way with letting Ruby get in a position to
where he could have an opportunity to shoot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you find any evidence that would indicate anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No evidence whatsoever were we able to find.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were looking for such?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Yes; we certainly were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Chief, what was your intention had you found such evidence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Proper action would have been taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And by that you mean what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. The officer, if criminal negligence had been established, he would
have been filed on by us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, there has been also the rumor that while the police did not
actively cooperate, that they saw Jack Ruby there, didn't pay much attention to
him, were really appalled when he did what he did, and then after that, engaged
in a cover-up activity to preserve the reputation of the police department. Can
you tell us whether your investigative efforts were directed toward uncovering
any evidence which might throw light on that matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. This investigation which was conducted was a completely impartial
investigation.</p>

<p>We in the police department for a number of years have felt like if there is
anything wrong in our department, we want to know it, and if actions of the
officers are improper, an examination of our records through the years will show
that we have taken whatever action was indicated, whether this be filing on a
man for law violations or for improper conduct or whatever it might be. The
seriousness of the offense is certainly not covered up and through the years we
have a reputation for a high standard of conduct and the integrity of the department
has not been questioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are satisfied that from all you know that there has been
no effort to cover up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir; not to my knowledge, and had there been and it had come
to my knowledge, I certainly would have done something about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are satisfied that the evidence shows that really Ruby came
through one man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was Vaughn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything else to say, chief?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. No, sir; I believe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, sir, on behalf of the Commission and myself personally, I
want to thank you very much for coming here and being frank and contributing,
I think, a great deal of the permanent record in this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. Thank you, sir, if there is anything that I might know that I
haven't brought out, I will be happy to. The only thing I can say is that our
security broke down at one place. I can't deny that, and I don't think it intentional
on the part of the police department to have this thing occur.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that's covered. I wanted to ask you those questions and
I think they are going to be asked and we are going to have an answer to them
now and you are the man to do it. Thank you very much, chief.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Curry</span>. All right. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="JEB">TESTIMONY OF SHERIFF J. E. (BILL) DECKER</h2>

<p>The testimony of Sheriff J.&nbsp;E. (Bill) Decker was taken at 10:44 a.m., on April
16, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of J.&nbsp;E. (Bill) Decker.</p>

<p>Mr. Decker, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff
of the general counsel of the President's Commission under the provisions of
Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, the joint resolution of Congress
137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in conformity with
the Executive order and the joint resolution. I have been authorized to take a
sworn deposition from you, Sheriff Decker. I state to you now that the general
nature of the inquiry of the Commission's inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and
to report upon facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and the
subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Sheriff Decker, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you may know about the death of Oswald and any other
pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry, including the security
of Oswald, and the method and so forth by which he was killed.</p>

<p>I think, Sheriff Decker, that you have appeared here today by virtue of a
letter written to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes; I think that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is the General Counsel of the staff of the President's
Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I know there was a letter&mdash;anyway, I am here due to that
reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I had the impression you had a letter, but let me say this, that
in any event, you are appearing here by virtue of a request made to appear
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I was notified by the U.S. Secret Service to appear here and I
presume that was a summons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, that would be because we did not wish to go through the
formalities here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In that case, however, I must state to you that under the rules
and regulations of the Commission, every witness is entitled to a 3-day written
notice before appearing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But the Commission does provide that the witness may waive
that 3 days' notice and I now ask you if you are willing to waive it and testify
now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you stand up, please, and I will administer the oath? Do
you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Bill Decker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Sir, 66.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. 6302 Palo Pinto.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I am sheriff of Dallas County.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been sheriff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Since January 1, 1949.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you have been reelected a number of times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I am serving my 16 years&mdash;I had two of those&mdash;one of those terms
for a 4-year term, but we caught 2 years prior to that&mdash;that makes 4 from 16,
leaves 12, 3 and 1 is 4 terms and I am coming for my fifth now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your occupation prior to the time that you became
sheriff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I was chief deputy sheriff for Dallas County 14 years prior to
that. Prior to that I was chief deputy constable since 1924, prior to that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
was in the courthouse as a court clerk and prior to that I was elevator operator
in the courthouse. Now, that's it&mdash;that's my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You started really at the bottom you might say, and went up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are married, of course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have a family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I have one adopted son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I&mdash;as I understand it, it is your responsibility to operate
the State or county jail for those prisoners who are either serving terms that
may be served there, or who are awaiting a trial in Dallas County and do not
make bond, is that correct, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. That is correct. I am keeper of the county security building,
of the county jail, which maintains the prisoners.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is located where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. 505 Main Street, the corner of Main and Houston, and it extends
to the corner of Elm and Houston in the rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when prisoners are put in your custody or you take them
into your custody who are awaiting trial, where are they placed, in cell blocks
or something of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Oh, yes; we have a jail there with a capacity of 750 prisoners.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have what might be called maximum security there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes; I do&mdash;there are many maximums&mdash;I have 450 maximum-security
cells that's the latest that can be built. The others are built in the
old jail which was built in 1913. Of course, my steel isn't so good in that
old jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By maximum security, you mean, of course, maximum security
from the standpoint that the prisoner can't get out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. It is tool proof steel, one, and two, it is the modern locks. The
man who maintains it&mdash;the opening and closing of the doors to it is in a cell
block where the prisoners could not get to him unless he did as a couple of my
boys did the other day, I'm sorry to say. You don't need to put that in there.
They are no longer with me. They opened the door when they had no business
to and they lost their jobs and I lost five prisoners.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does maximum security as it operates with you include considerations
of security to the prisoner himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you consider it to be your function, not merely to secure
the prisoner so that he may be brought to justice or acquitted, but also so that
his personal security will be maintained and he will not be injured, either by
other prisoners or by outsiders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Well, I even go further than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, will you tell us about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. A prisoner that is delivered to me&mdash;when the crime is committed,
he is then delivered to me and when he is delivered to me, from then on I am
his keeper. I must furnish his food, his clothing, get his medication and all the
necessities of life required. I must protect him from a violent prisoner and
I also must protect him from a citizen who would desire to do harm to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you consider that your physical set up, and by that I mean,
bricks and cement and steel as well as personnel is adequate to accomplish
the purposes that you have described as maximum security?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. We feel that our men are qualified from the training that is
given to them, one; that the jail has passed Federal jail inspection on many
occasions; and we feel that our jail is so constructed that the prisoner is
protected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, of course, you are aware that a man by the name of Lee
Harvey Oswald was in the custody of the Dallas police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes; I had some officers present when he was arrested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From the sheriff's office&mdash;sheriff's officers were present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes; sheriff's officers were present in Oak Cliff at the time.
They responded to the assassination of the killing of Tippit, the same as others.
You see, I was at the scene of the assassination of the President.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. When my officers were dispatched there, I also told some other
agencies to send their men over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what is the custom with respect to prisoners who are captured
or taken into custody by the city police when there is no warrant of
arrest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Most prisoners taken in custody by the city police are arrested
within the corporate limits of the city of Dallas and they in turn are moved
to the city jail, which is located at the corner of Main and Harwood, or better
still, in the 2000 block of Main Street, and there confined until their period
of investigation is completed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Well, now, that's a problem I couldn't&mdash;there would be no way
to answer that&mdash;how long does it take to make some investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I had in mind was whether there was any rule, regulation,
or law?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. No; someone said once you couldn't hold them over 24 or 36
hours, but where it is, I don't know. The city ordinance under which most
municipalities work is&mdash;they have a right to arrest and hold for investigation
until they could determine if a crime has been committed. That leaves it
pretty blank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, let's assume that a man has been formally
charged and that there has been a capias or <span class="locked">warrant&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. It's a warrant in this case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of arrest, which authorizes you to arrest the particular prisoner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I or one of the constables.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your custom&mdash;are there any rules or regulations or laws?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. No; there's no rules or regulations&mdash;only this&mdash;when a warrant
is issued&mdash;when a complaint is filed with my district attorney or the magistrate,
which is the justice of the peace, the warrant is issued and delivered to the
agency. If it is a felony and in the justice court, it goes to the constable, which
this offense we are speaking about was a felony and should have gone to David
Johnston, justice of the peace, precinct 2, and the warrants were delivered to
the city police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are talking about the charge with respect to Tippit,
are you, or the death of the President, or both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Well, I rather think it was both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The warrants then were not put into your possession at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. No, sir; not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is in accordance with the custom, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would normally happen in circumstances such as we are
dealing with here, where warrants were issued about 7 o'clock in one case, as
to Tippit, and a little later about 11 o'clock on the 22d of November, as to the
death of the President, what would be the normal situation as to your getting
control and custody and your becoming the keeper of these prisoners?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. The whole thing would be that if we, if those warrants had
come through the regular channels to us, we would have contacted&mdash;I imagine
we would have contacted Captain Fritz because it was a homicide and that is
in his division, and asked him about the prisoner and discussed with him if he
was ready for transfer&mdash;if he was going to transfer or did he want us to
transfer. That would have been the normal procedure with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, it is normal to have them transfer the prisoner
to you, rather than for you to go and get them, or both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. No; it is normal but it is not too much&mdash;they transfer maybe
one-tenth of maybe 1 percent, but as hot a piece of merchandise as this prisoner
was, chances are Captain Fritz and his men would have attempted to bring
him from the city hall to the courthouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, except in rare instances, meaning a situation of
this sort, you send your men to the city jail to get them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Day in and day out. We have a paddy wagon for that purpose
and a driver for the purpose and uniforms and insignias and all on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when did you make any efforts to take custody of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I can't tell you that as to when&mdash;the homicide occurred and the
boy was taken in custody in the afternoon and that was on a Friday&mdash;I'm not
going to tell you for certain because there was so much and on Friday afternoon
we were taking statements in my office&mdash;you know&mdash;this thing happened,
occurred just across the street from my office and we moved all the witnesses
when we were on the ground there at the scene, all the witnesses we could
locate&mdash;I was working there and I had Inspector Sawyer, who is there with
me, and also Heitman of the FBI and my assistant chief deputy, and every witness,
just as we picked up a witness that had any information at all, we sent
him directly across the street to my office and reduced his statement to writing.
Then, I talked to Fritz after he arrived.</p>

<p>We had by then located the gun and the ammunition, my officers had located
it in the building, and was awaiting the arrival of the scene searchers and also
the arrival of my scene searchers and Fritz arrived and then I talked to Fritz
and then we went across the street and he phoned and that's when I learned
Oswald had been formerly employed there at that building.</p>

<p>And, Fritz went to the city&mdash;now, here's something I'm uncertain about&mdash;whether
I talked to him that afternoon or the next day about this removal,
I cannot tell you because there was so much happening and so much press in our
hair, I couldn't say, but I did discuss with him and advise with that I wished to
be notified when he started to move this boy, so that I would have my security
in shape to receive him when he arrived there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think that was no later than Saturday, the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Oh, no; it wasn't. I don't think it was any later than that&mdash;no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, as I understood you, you couldn't tell whether
it was on Friday or Saturday, but it could not have been Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. No; it wasn't Sunday. I remember there were different conversations
on Sunday, different conversations on Saturday and different conversations
on Saturday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, perhaps if you can, you can tell us about these various
conversations, if you remember them&mdash;who they were with and about what
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Well, on Saturday, the homicide, I believe, if I'm correct&mdash;now,
the date of the homicide of Oswald was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was Sunday the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. The 24th&mdash;Sunday. Friday, after we had completed our investigation
and gotten our files together to some extent, we then closed shop, shall
we say, and went back into our routine work, and on Saturday arrival at our
office we then again, I'm reasonably sure that was the day, we talked about
moving Oswald but I just don't remember. That's one of those things you just
don't remember the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you talked to Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. That's when I talked to Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did Fritz tell you, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. He said he would notify me when he was ready to move.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He wasn't ready at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. He wasn't ready at that time, witnesses were being brought in,
he was still interviewing witnesses. Now, then, later that afternoon the rumor
was out that they were going to bring him down&mdash;of course, we had rumors,
rumors, rumors all the day, because we had worldwide press and they were
in the city hall, you couldn't get in the city hall for them and they were running
back and forth down to our pressroom, and this word was here that they were
coming, so late that afternoon, on Saturday, Jim Kerr was the first man that
brought me the date of the 10 o'clock transfer Sunday morning. Jim Kerr is
associated with channel 5, and there were several of the pressmen in my
office and members of my staff and we were discussing it and later in the
evening, later about 9 o'clock it was getting on to be, and he notified us they
were going to move in and I think I then confirmed that with someone in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
city and they said yes&mdash;the next morning at 10 o'clock and then I went to my
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they say "Next morning at 10," or not before 10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. They said "around 10 o'clock."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You got that, though, from newsmen, you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Jim Kerr is the man that gave me the information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't talk to Fritz or Curry about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. No; but I checked it up at the city with somebody there, and
I don't know who it was now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You, yourself, don't know who it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I checked it on the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don't remember who you talked to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. No; I don't remember who I talked to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was confirmed that he would not be moved that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. It was confirmed that he wouldn't be moved that night and that's
all there was to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you say your normal operations went on and I assume you
went to your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you get to your office on Sunday, the 24th of
November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. It was before 10&mdash;around 10 o'clock&mdash;wait a minute, let me see if
I can refresh my memory just a little bit here [examining records in his possession].
I am considering that time of when I was advised by the city that transfer
might be made the first time, if you care to incorporate this in there&mdash;the first
time was 3:30 p.m. Saturday. At that time it was not at 10 o'clock. I have this
note&mdash;however, I arrived at my office early Sunday morning to recheck all
security measures that had been provided for the transfer of Oswald, so what
would be early for me, sir, I am a man that doesn't get down to the office
until 9 o'clock, and so if I arrived at 9 o'clock, that would be early arrival for
me, so you can place it near that period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Decker, I would like for you to carry on from there in
narrative form as to just all of the events that happened as they came to your
knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. You mean on that morning, on Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. For additional security, I placed all members of the press&mdash;you
see, I forgot to give you this a moment ago&mdash;on Saturday afternoon and Saturday
night when they learned that they were going to transfer Oswald down
there, the world's press moved from the 2000 block on Main to the 500 block on
Main. They were laying on my floor, they were laying on the <span class="locked">sidewalks&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean that was Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. That was Saturday night, waiting for the Sunday morning
transfer. They just started moving out of the city hall and moved down there&mdash;suddenly
they were all over the streets, the sidewalks, the floors, we had
cameras running out our ears.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Television too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes; everything&mdash;live television moved in, and some remained
at the city, you see, and they set up down there a press&mdash;back and forth&mdash;so, I
heard that my halls were full and my carport was full, so I moved them all
out. I told them to come in the building, bring their cameras with them, that
they were going to utilize, and the remainder not operate unless they were on
the street&mdash;into a room&mdash;you will have to see my building to realize it&mdash;it's
where you walk in the front, you see, the building is on Main and you come in
the rear from the carport. There is a room that runs down about 45 or 40
feet, which is just an open hall space and a room where people stand who are
attempting to get information out of the jail or visit someone in the jail, and
I moved them into that and closed the doors on them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you cleared them from where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I cleared them from the carport, where the man would be
brought in, and put them behind locked doors&mdash;I'm talking about steel doors,
now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, there was no news press or anybody else at the spot where
the prisoner would be brought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Well, there may have been some on the street&mdash;I'm not so sure
of that&mdash;but what I mean, I cleared the port and kept them in this room where
they could only see him as he came by one door and by the second door, and
they were away from him a distance then. He was to be in the carport and
they were 20 or 25 feet back in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you had them under lock and key, but they could see
out&mdash;could they see through windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. No; bars, they were barred doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. They were barred doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you put all the press people out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you check to see whether they were press people or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. All in all&mdash;I was under the impression that they were&mdash;that
the majority of them were press people. I don't think there was anybody in
that room that wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean, did you have any system of checking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. No; I didn't personally check and search each one of them
because they had so darn much equipment&mdash;everybody had equipment&mdash;I don't
care who they were, and I had my officers mix and mingle with them and
knew most of them. You see, we got pretty well acquainted with that press
for 2 or 3 days there because they were continually in our hair, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir; go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. At the outside drive, or at the entrance to my carport&mdash;I moved
a couple of my men&mdash;four or five of my special men there to be sure that it was
clear when the man did arrive. I had been notified by Curry that maybe they
would bring him down in an armored car and I had some other rumors&mdash;they
would be bringing him in a car, and about that time on those live TV cameras
in that room, the flash came that shots had been fired, that there was a riot
on in the basement of the city hall, and if you will pardon my French and you
don't need to put this in here, young lady, "We caught lightening in the jug in
that room," sir. There is no question. They tried to crawl the walls, they
tried to tear down those barred doors, they tried to do everything to get out
of there and it looked like I would never get them out of the damn room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean the ones you had locked up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. The press&mdash;they were locked up and couldn't get out of there
with all of their equipment, so as I say, "We caught lightening in the jug."
There wasn't any question. Finally, I got the doors open and they tore out on
Main Street and out on Houston Street and commandeered cars with cameras
hanging on their backs, some of their own equipment, back up Main Street. I
lost the majority of them then for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you been given any warning by the FBI that they had
received a message, or had the message been received, I think, by your office,
that some attempt would be made by a group to injure Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. That's along 12:30 or 1 o'clock in the morning&mdash;that's when
that occurred. That's when I got on the telephone, you see, sir&mdash;I'm sure
that you don't understand this, but, you know, but no man&mdash;it makes no difference
how long he is an officer, ever imagined that he could work on an
investigation the size of this one and therefore, of course, you realize that my
officers and I'm sure some of the city officers, myself included, were working
under just a little bit of pressure.</p>

<p>Anyway, this thing you are talking about came to me from my office man,
Sergeant McCoy, and he had received a call from the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Milt Newsom, who stated to him that this boy was going to be
killed and that he had good information. He relayed that message to me at
my home, and I asked him had the city been notified and he said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was early in the morning, as I recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. It was 12:30; 12:30 in the night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 12:30 on the morning of the 24th?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes; and I called that office and I talked to a man whom I
believe to be Frazier, is that correct?</p>

<p>I don't know the gentleman only there by telephone conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You, yourself, talked to him and told him what you had
heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I told him what I had heard and talked to him about the transfer,
and I even went so far as to advise McCoy to call in a pair of my supervisory
personnel to stand by my office, that should they decide to transfer
this man, they would be available and we would have the other men moved
in there to make it secure&mdash;to have the security.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make any suggestions that he be moved earlier than
the time that had been announced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I did. I suggested to get the man on down to the lower end of
Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before the time announced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes; then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did you say that to&mdash;Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I'm sure I told it to Frazier and I'm sure there was one or
somebody in Fritz' office&mdash;I don't remember whether it was Baker or Wells,
I talked to one of those persons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was when you got this call from the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. When I got this call from my night sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was still nighttime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes&mdash;it was in the morning&mdash;12:30 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was your suggestion that he should be moved immediately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I felt that he should be moved&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What reply did you get?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. They stated that they were going to ask him if he wouldn't
feel better to talk to his superiors and see what could be done. He called me
back shortly and stated that he had had no success in contacting them, and I
think that was about the extent of our conversation. I kept my men, my supervisory
personnel standing by in the event that they did change their timing or
anything and notified us. I asked him if he had any success to call me and
that we would make arrangements to take care of the prisoner either way, and
I meant by that that we would transfer him or whatever was necessary to be
done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At this point let me ask you: When a man is transferred to
your custody, may he thereafter be interviewed by the city police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Anybody who wishes to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that Captain Fritz and others could have continued their
investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. It's not customary for them to bring a prisoner down until they
have finished their investigation in the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that, but the transfer to you would not have cut
off their opportunity to investigate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Oh, no&mdash;no&mdash;it wouldn't have cut it off to anybody&mdash;any law
enforcing agency. Just the same as Ruby, Ruby has been interviewed in my
jail by city police, the FBI agents, and incidentally may I ask you a question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. If you can answer it, all well and good&mdash;I can't. I keep getting
information here that we are going to have you people&mdash;you people are going
to attempt to interview this prisoner that I have now, and if that is correct,
why of course I would like to make some provisions to talk to somebody before
it happens. Of course, it will take a court order for me to move him, which
of course you know is no trouble to obtain&mdash;you know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I can't comment on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Don't, if you can't, sir&mdash;it's all right, but of course I am leaving
that with you that I would like to have some advance knowledge. You can
comment on that&mdash;that you will do it if you have any knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I'm sure if such a decision is made by the people who are
authorized to make it, that they will cooperate with you in every way possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. And, I would like to keep it out of the press also because every
time I turn around with Mr. Ruby, I am blasted with this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, that's another matter&mdash;that's out of my control.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I repeat that I think that if such a thing should come about,
that you would be contacted and that the various problems that might exist
in the matter would be discussed with you fully and that the persons representing
the Commission would cooperate with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I'm sure they will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In every way you wish them to do so, consistent, of course, with
their mission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. It makes no difference. I'm sorry, but I don't seem to have
in this file Perry McCoy's statement. I think you have a statement from McCoy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. He made one&mdash;stating the times that he talked to the man, the
conversations, and substantiated exactly practically what I said to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think we have covered the point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I know you have because I sent him up there to be interviewed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I have heretofore shown you two documents identified as
follows: The first being a report of an interview of you by Officer Neeley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On November 27, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. That's where I told him I didn't wish to discuss the matter
any further over the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I have identified it by marking on the margin, "Dallas, Texas,
April 16, 1964, Exhibit 5321, Deposition of Sheriff J.&nbsp;E. Decker." That consists
of one page.</p>

<p>The second document also consists of one page. It is a report of an interview
by James W. Bookhout of you on November 28, 1963. That document I have
marked for identification as follows:</p>

<p>"Dallas, Texas, April 16, 1964, Exhibit 5322, Deposition of Sheriff J.&nbsp;E.
Decker," and I have signed my name. I think you have had an opportunity
to read these two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I should like to ask you, sir, if these documents are fair statements
of the interviews that you had with the FBI agents indicated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are they correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any comment to make with respect to either one of
them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. No, sir; I think they speak for themselves, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. May I ask if you have any particular comment, sheriff, to make
with regard to the last paragraph of exhibit 5321, which reads in part as follows:</p>

<p>"Sheriff Decker stated that he had no desire to discuss this matter further
and does not desire to furnish any details of the conversations he had with
the Police Department and declined to say whether he advised the Police Department
he had a preference as to the time of day the transfer of the prisoner
should be made."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. That was a telephone conversation. I had an office full of people
and that's what it was and I didn't make any statement&mdash;no more than I made
directly to you here about the call, and which McCoy made, which is a statement
which you have from McCoy in your files.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand it, then, your explanation of the paragraph is
that you did not wish to discuss the matter further over the telephone and in
the presence of the people who were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Well, I don't believe I went that far. I just said I didn't care
to discuss it any further and I got my friend Neeley off the line. That's all
there was to it. And I never had the opportunity to talk to him afterward
again until I met him several days ago, you know, he works in north Texas
and is in and out, but that's all the conversation he and I had&mdash;what you have
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what I had in mind to ask you was this: On the face of
the paragraph that I have just read from Exhibit 5321, it looks like there was
an attitude on your part that you didn't wish to cooperate with the FBI&mdash;I
am just simply wanting to get the record straight from your point of view&mdash;as
to what was your intention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. As I said at that time&mdash;I didn't care to discuss it any further
at that time. That's all there is to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; I understand, but this paragraph is correct and stands
as it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes, sir; I did not&mdash;at that time I didn't discuss it. There was
no reason to go into why, and why&mdash;I told him my reasons a moment ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, sheriff, I have noticed that you have looked from time to
time at a book which I gather must be your own or the official record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. No; it's part of my records there. It doesn't have all the statements
in it as it should have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were copies of those statements made&mdash;are they available?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. They are yours&mdash;you can have them if you want them to keep
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. You can have the whole thing. The only thing that is not in
there is McCoy's and about three or four other statements. I will submit the
whole thing to you if you want it right now. You can take it with you. I have
no objections.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you wish to have this returned to you&mdash;this seems to be a
copy anyway&mdash;this is not the original.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Yes; those are photostatic copies. I can furnish you those
others&mdash;I can furnish you that copy on McCoy and I can furnish the copy on two
or three others that I have down there but I don't know where McCoy's is and
I don't know whether they left it out of there or not&mdash;since McCoy's I have
testified to, I would like to furnish it to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. And will send it to you shortly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me mark this document, then&mdash;I am marking it, "Dallas,
Tex., April 16, 1964, as Exhibit 5323, Deposition of Sheriff J.&nbsp;E. Decker," and
I am signing my name to it.</p>

<p>The document is actually a dark brown heavy folder with an Acco fastener.
It is called Acco Press on the inside and bears the label on the outside, "Harvey
Lee Oswald, WM 24, Murder&mdash;11-22-63 of John Fitzgerald Kennedy; W-M-46,
President of the United States. Assault to murder: Gov. John B. Connally."
On the left hand bottom side of the cover is a sticker on which there is typewritten
"File of: Sheriff's Department, Dallas, Tex., Bill Decker, Sheriff,"
under which I have written the identification of it as I dictated it a moment
ago into the record.</p>

<p>Turning on to the inside of the book, it seems to be divided up into parts.
There is a yellow, light cardboard division marker, which in the left hand bottom
says, "Crime Reports." In that are 2 yellow sheets and 10 white sheets. I am
marking the cover with my initials and the yellow and white sheets with my
initials, all in the lower right hand corner. The next subdivision which is made
by a light cardboard sheet, is entitled, "Witness affidavits." I am marking it
with my initials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Now, you are supposed to have copies of all of those affidavits
come to you from some agency&mdash;I don't know which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And, each of the sheets thereof I am marking with my initials.
There are 35 of such sheets.</p>

<p>Then, in the last part of the book, also divided by a light yellow cardboard
sheet on which I am putting my initials, that division sheet is entitled "Officers
supplement," and there are 42 sheets which I have marked with my initials.
Is this document, Sheriff Decker, that you have handed me a complete record of
what you have concerning Oswald? I think you mentioned that there might
be one document or two that you wished to send me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I would like to send you a copy of McCoy's statement, a copy
of McCoy's report in there and maybe a couple of other statements, that's all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
There may be some others&mdash;I can send those to you anywhere&mdash;Washington or
anywhere, it makes no difference, or I can send them up here to you in the next
45 minutes after I leave here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After lunch will be all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Fine, I will send them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I will just attach them to this exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. That's all right&mdash;they belong in there and I don't know how they
got out, but in comparing them, making a new one up, you lose some once in a
while&mdash;as much paperwork as we do in law enforcement fields this day and time,
you lose a heck of a lot of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Sheriff Decker, has any member of the Commission's staff
interviewed you other than myself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything further you wish to add?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I don't know why I should take any more of your time. You
have practically everything I have that is of value to you. If there is anything
further you want&mdash;we are available and you have a big job to <span class="locked">do&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, that's all right&mdash;that's what I'm here for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But if we know all that you know, then that's all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. That's right&mdash;so, there is no reason of going over it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it your thought that considering your testimony here today
and what you have told the FBI and your <span class="locked">records&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. And my records that I have given to you&mdash;turned over to you
and what my other deputies have given to you, I don't know of any reason to
take up any more of your time, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. I will be delighted to have you come and see my operation before
you leave and it might clear up some things there for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="WBF">TESTIMONY OF CAPT. W. B. FRAZIER</h2>

<p>The testimony of Capt. W.&nbsp;B. Frazier was taken at 2 p.m., on March 25, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Capt. W.&nbsp;B. Frazier, Dallas Police
Department. Captain Frazier, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the
advisory staff of the general counsel on the President's Commission on the
Assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Under the provisions of President Johnson's Executive Order
No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and the Joint Resolution of Congress No.
137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the President's Commission in conformance
with the Executive order and the joint resolution, I have been authorized
to take a sworn deposition from you, among many officers of the detective
bureau. Your name has been specifically mentioned as a person from whom I
could take a sworn deposition. I state to you now that the general nature of the
Commission's inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relating
to the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death
of Lee Harvey Oswald. In particular as to you, Captain Frazier, the nature of
the inquiry today is to determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald
and any other pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry. Now,
Captain, you have appeared here today by virtue of a letter addressed to Chief
Curry by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, who is the general counsel for the President's Commission.
Under the rules adopted by the Commission every witness is entitled
to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of his deposition. The rules also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
provide, however, that if the witness wishes he may waive the 3-day notice in
writing. I say to you that you have a right to the 3-day notice, which you have
not received, but I ask you if you wish to waive that 3 <span class="locked">day&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't <span class="locked">wish&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, I will waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You do not wish to persist in your right to have the 3-day notice?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then I'll ask you to stand, sir, and raise your right hand to
be sworn. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. William Bennett Frazier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Forty-three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. 2205 Newcastle, Garland, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been on the police department of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. For 17½ years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have the rank of captain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What particular function or duties are you assigned to in the
department, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I am in charge of the radio patrol platoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is your immediate superior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Chief N. T. Fisher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have the same rank and the same duties during the
period November 22 to 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I did, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I understand that you were on duty on the morning of the
24th of November, is that correct, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you come on duty? Do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. At 11 p.m., on the 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that is what they call the first shift?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. First platoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. First platoon, rather, and that goes until roughly 7 in the
morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Around 7; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been on duty the night before, that is, on first platoon.
That would have <span class="locked">been&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. What day would it have been, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, it would have been the 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I mean, what day of the week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, the day before would have been Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; I was on duty at the time. That would have been the
first platoon. Yes, sir; I was on duty at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was your office, in fact, in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. On the second floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have anything to do at all with the interrogation, or the
security of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, on the 24th of November, about in the middle of the shift
there, about 3 or 3:30 or 3:45 that morning, I understand you received a telephone
call from an FBI agent, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; Mr. Newsom, I believe his name is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell me how it came to you? How did the call come to
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Mr. Newsom called me and said he had received a threat from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
some man to the effect that a group of men, I believe he indicated they had
100 or 200, I don't recall the exact number, were going to attempt to kill
Oswald that day sometime. That he didn't want the FBI, Dallas Police Department
or the sheriff's office injured in any way. That was the reason for the
call. So, Mr. Newsom called me and related that story to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you in charge of the police department at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I was in charge of the patrol section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Patrol section?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What other senior officers were on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I guess I was the senior on any division at that morning; yes,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand it, Chief Curry was not there, Chief Batchelor
was not there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Stevenson was not there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is your immediate superior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Fisher. He was not there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You, in fact, were the ranking officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. On duty at that time; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you aware of that? I mean, are you made aware of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Oh, yes, sir; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How is it done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Well, just the fact that the officers under&mdash;who rank under you
are there, and there is nobody of equal rank or higher present in the entire
police department, it reverts to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The highest in rank is in charge of the whole operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, if someone had asked for who was in&mdash;if Newsom had asked
to speak to the top man in charge, you were that man, that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you heard any of that news of that sort from another
source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Deputy Cox, or Coy in the
<span class="locked">sheriff's&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I talked to that man later on in the morning after Mr. Newsom
called me. But I don't know the name, whether it was Coy, or Cox, but he indicated
that Sheriff Decker wanted to talk to Chief Curry in regards to moving
Oswald, so, I, in turn then attempted to contact Chief Curry by telephone and his
line was busy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I don't know. 5:45, 6 o'clock, somewhere along there. Then I
tried for some 10 or 15 minutes to get his line, and it was busy, so, I asked the
operator to check into it. She came back and said the line was out of order,
so, I in turn, was preparing to send a squad by the chief's home and tell him of
the information and that Decker wanted him to call him and Captain Talbert relieved
me around 6 or 6:15. I give him the information and he said he sent a
squad later and told the chief about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think earlier you had called Captain Fritz, hadn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, I called Captain Fritz once or twice in an effort to see if
they were handling it or if the chief was handling it, or if homicide&mdash;Captain
Fritz was handling it. Since he is the captain in charge of that particular
bureau, so, naturally I called him first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was when you got the message from Newsom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. A little while later; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. He said I should talk to Chief Curry, that he was handling
the transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That Chief <span class="locked">Curry&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; not him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Not him? Did he tell you of any plans made for the transfer?
Did Captain Fritz tell you of any plans made for the transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I don't recall, sir. He may have said&mdash;I'm not sure. I heard
this later on in the morning, I think, but I'm not sure. He may have said
then that he planned to move him around 10 the next day. I don't recall
whether he said it or some other officer said it later on in the morning, but I
did hear it. Now, I don't say whether Captain Fritz is the one that told me
or not. I don't recall the exact conversation there other than the fact that I
had asked him if he was handling it and he said, "No." Chief Curry was
handling it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember when you spoke to Mr. Newsom from the
FBI whether Mr. Newsom told you that the Dallas Sheriff's Office had received
a similar call to the one he was relating to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No; I don't recall that. He possibly&mdash;he could have said it,
but I do not recall it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When the gentlemen from the sheriff's office, either Cox or
Coy, called you that was simply about when the transfer was going to take
place, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I assume that is what it was. He indicated to me that Decker
wanted to get ahold of Chief Curry and move him as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did that man mention to you about the receipt of any threats
such as Newsom had told you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the second threat you had received that morning?
In other words, the threat came from two sources, so far as you know. You
heard it from the FBI, and this man from the sheriff's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. <span class="locked">Indicated&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Indicated that he had received a threat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I believe he did; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember saying to Mr. Newsom that the plan to transfer
Oswald to the county jail might be changed in view of the threat that he
had conveyed to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; no, sir. That wasn't any of my business, that transfer,
and I'm sure I didn't relate that to him, because I'd be telling him something
that I didn't know about, really, at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember telling Mr. Newsom of the FBI, on the occasion
that he called you that morning around 2 or 2:30, that Oswald's plans
of transfer had been publicized primarily as a form of cooperation with press
and news agencies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not make <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Huh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not make that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I did not make any such statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any planned transfer, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. All I knew that they was supposed to move the next day, and
then perhaps later in the morning I&mdash;maybe Captain Fritz told me that they
were supposed to move him around 10 a.m., that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is as to time, but did you know of any plans prior to going
off duty that day as to the method, the route, and the vehicles to be used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you go off duty, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It was around 6 or 6:15, or something like that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you come back then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. If that <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you leave the department and go home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; I went home and I went to bed. I was asleep when Oswald
was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you hear about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. My wife awakened me shortly thereafter. She had seen it on
TV. She was watching the transfer on TV, and she awakened me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go down there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I called and asked if they needed me. They said,
"No, stay where you are. You will have to work tonight." So, I stayed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Fritz has said&mdash;did I understand you to say, that Curry was
in charge of all transfers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Was in charge of that transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of that particular&mdash;of Oswald's transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of W.&nbsp;J. Harrison, I think they
call him "Blackie," a detective?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; he is a patrolman temporarily assigned to CID. Yes,
sir; I believe he is in the juvenile bureau. I'm not sure, but I think he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear him talk about his experiences on the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I haven't seen him. I haven't seen "Blackie" in, I
guess, 6 months or so, maybe longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Patrick Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. P. T. Dean? Sergeant Dean? I know him; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you spoken to him about his activities on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he works on another platoon and another captain
and I don't come in contact with him very often except just to say hello as
we are going off duty or coming on and only one I confer with is the captain
in charge of the platoon coming on when I leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The radio patrol is what, actually?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. It is the regular squad car, two-man squad car that patrols
the entire city. We have anywhere from 185 to 205 men on duty at most platoons.
However, our day platoon is our lowest. It will run 120, 125.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. These men are cruising areas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; districts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And they are controlled by radio communication from your
office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; from the dispatcher's office, which <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, if you want to contact any of those people you can do it
directly, you do it through a dispatcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Through the dispatcher; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you&mdash;were you on duty when the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you called in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You just took your regular shift at 11 o'clock that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had gotten off at 7 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. 6 or 7 that morning; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If we would want to find out about the dispatch sent out right
after the President's death, or right before, whom would we contact? What
would be the name of the officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Lumpkin, George Lumpkin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Lumpkin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; he is in charge of all communications and I believe
most of that is on tape. They tried to tape most of the conversations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They keep the tape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes; permanent records, as I understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you a document which I have marked for identification
with the following inscription, in my own handwriting, "Dallas, Tex.,
March 25, 1964, Exhibit 5086, deposition of W.&nbsp;B. Frazier." I have signed
the first page, and placed my initials in the lower right hand corner of the
second page. I'll ask you if that statement&mdash;if you have read that document
and whether it is substantially correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would ask you, therefore, if you would sign your name under
mine and place your initials under mine on the second page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Right here, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; right there and then sign your name on the front page
right under my signature there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Over here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I hand you another document which I have marked for&mdash;"Dallas,
Tex., March 25, 1964, Exhibit 5087, deposition of W.&nbsp;B. Frazier." I
have signed my name to the bottom of this document which purports to be a
report by Special Agent Melton L. Newsom of the FBI, of a conversation which
he had over the telephone with you on November 24, 1963, at about 3:20 a.m.,
and I'll ask you if that report by Mr. Newsom of that conversation is a correct
report of that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I don't believe it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you indicate what parts are correct and what parts are
wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Now, you are asking of my own knowledge, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Now, this first paragraph here, I know nothing of this. Mr.
Glassup. He didn't talk to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I think <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. And, he received the call I understand here, and it goes into,
"I represent a committee that&mdash;it is neither right nor left wing," and so forth.
I didn't get all that in the conversation with Newsom, that I recall. Newsom
told me that a group of men, I believe he indicated a hundred or two were
going to kill Oswald the following day, the day after the night&mdash;or, you know,
the next day or two. Now, that was essentially what he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you say he didn't tell you that had been received by Glassup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he said they received information, or threats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor did he give you the exact language of the threat, as indicated
in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He simply told you that they had received the threat and the
sense of the threat was along the lines of the paragraph, first paragraph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, neither mentioned Glassup's name, nor did he speak the
exact quoted language which&mdash;when he spoke to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what about the next paragraph, second paragraph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir; that is essentially correct. However, I believe he did
advise the Dallas sheriff's office had received a similar call. That is essentially
correct, that paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; what about the third paragraph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. The third paragraph, I don't recall making that statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the fourth paragraph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Because, at that time, I did not know exactly what the plans
were to move Oswald, see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what about the last paragraph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean to say that you do not recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; I do not recall making that statement to Mr. Newsom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like for you to do this then with reference to that document.
Just place the word, next to the last paragraph, "incorrect," and initial
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you initialled it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; now, with <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. And the top paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, the top <span class="locked">paragraph&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. I couldn't attest to that either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Please explain what your position is on it, and if you would
like to sign your name just below mine so then we have the matter in hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, is there anything else that you would like to state that
has not been said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir; nothing more to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to the commencement of this deposition with you, have
you been interviewed by any member of the Commission's Staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were not interviewed by me, in fact, before it began?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frazier</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your particular assignment now?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Commanding officer in the forgery bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are under Chief Stevenson?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. M. W. Stevenson is my superior officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your rank and duties were the same during the period of
November 22 and 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Captain, I show you three documents which I am numbering&mdash;I
show you three documents upon which I am writing the following in
the lower right-hand corner. "Dallas, Texas, March 24, 1964. Exhibit No.
5054, deposition of Capt. O.&nbsp;A. Jones." Beneath which I have signed my name,
Leon D. Hubert. The second document which I am endorsing "Dallas, Texas,
March 24, 1964, Exhibit No. 5055, deposition of Capt. O.&nbsp;A. Jones," and I am signing
my signature below that. That document consisting of three pages, and I
am initialing&mdash;two other&mdash;to revert back for a moment to No. 5054, that has
a second page and I am placing my initials on the second page of that document
in the lower right-hand corner. Third document, I am writing on the right-hand
margin the following: "Dallas, Texas, March 24, 1964. Exhibit 5056.
Deposition of Capt. O.&nbsp;A. Jones," and I am signing my name below that. That
document containing three pages. I am taking my initials and placing them
on the second and third pages. Now, Captain, I think you have read these
three documents which <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I have; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I would like you to place your name below mine on each
one of these pages, please, and your initials below mine on the other pages, after
which I'm going to ask you some questions concerning these documents.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just below mine and then initial the second and third page below
my initials there. Now, Captain, I think you have already stated that you have
read these three documents?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Exhibit 5054, 5055, and 5056, and I am going to ask you if, in
your opinion, those documents represent the truth, or if you have any kind of
amendments, modifications, or additions that you want to make?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. There are some additions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state for the record what amendments or modifications,
whatever else you have to about the documents.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. This is off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, back on the record. Anyhow, with reference directed at
5054, Captain, what have you to say as to that? That being a report of Special
Agents James W. Bookhout and Joseph M. Meyers, of an interview of you by
those gentlemen on November 25, 1963.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. First, let me say that they make reference&mdash;they are correct,
but they have grouped together under "specific instructions that I received."
I received, at two different times, that is not at the same time. At first, when I
was sent downstairs Chief Stevenson gave me instructions to go to the Commerce
Street ramp, place two patrolmen there to assist an armored car down
that ramp to get it backed as far down as possible, down in the <span class="locked">basement&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before you leave that, do you know about what time it was?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I'd say only about 11 o'clock, and it could have been a little
before because of the amount of time required on that, but I didn't look at my
watch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Do you want me to go on to the other points?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. The other part. In one sentence I gave, he has specific instructions
about keeping them back, and Chief Batchelor and Chief Stevenson
did so later when they came to the basement, and I called the attention that
photographers were out in the other part of the jail office now, and there was
nothing said upstairs&mdash;said about clearing anything except what I said that one
thing, except&mdash;take&mdash;taking any detectives remaining on the third floor and
placing them where I wanted them, where I felt they would be needed. That
goes into it a little more in detail, but by having that in front of me right now.
If you could, I can show you the point that he states he instructed me to secure
the area for the transport of Lee Harvey Oswald from the Dallas City Jail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the Dallas County Jail&mdash;with additional specific instructions from Chief Stevenson
or Chief Batchelor or to have detectives under their supervision to question
the news media to keep the basement east of the driveway&mdash;that came up after
we got down in the basement, and it reads maybe as if it was given at another
place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you have just read and commented upon is from the first
paragraph of a document 5054? Right?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go ahead now.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. The&mdash;in other words, the two instructions given previously
before I went to the basement were: One, to arrange to have officers assist the
armored truck which they told me was en route, to back into the Commerce
Street ramp down into the city hall and as far as possible. Number two; take
any remaining detectives from the third floor down to the basement and place
them where I thought they might be needed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state for the record how you carried out those specific
orders?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir; I made a round of all CIB Bureaus, with the exception
of homicide and robbery, which was working on the assassination, and got&mdash;I
can't tell you, two or three or some detectives that were remaining, and we
went down the elevator. This is the one I went down with the&mdash;and I don't
know who they were, and don't have any names. Didn't make a detail&mdash;but
I went up and did see Patrolman Jez and one other patrolman that I don't know
his <span class="locked">name&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were in uniform?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. They were in uniform. They would remain and assist the
armored truck in backing down there. And the detectives that had come with
me were standing at the jail office. I had left them at the door of the jail
office, and coming back toward the ramp, I came upon Captain Talbert, in
charge of the patrol division, and told him that Patrolman Jez and the other
officer were up there and what the Chief had said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, have you any other comments to make <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Now, that is all about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I understand that that is document 5054?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Let me check on this now for sure. That is&mdash;yes; that is all
right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. And Exhibit 5055.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. May I ask you a question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Now then, the instructions about checking that, you want to
get to that later that I got&mdash;where Chief Batchelor and Chief <span class="locked">Stevenson&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I want to do is get through these documents.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. All right, sir. Now, our next exhibit. That would be 5055?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes. That is the letter addressed on November 26th, to Chief
J.&nbsp;E. Curry?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is a copy of the original which apparently was signed by
you?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have read it.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I have read it, and only one thing on that. That is on page 2,
at the top&mdash;where I had two different directions running from the jail office
door across the ramp running east, and then I turned and went south, and we
called that east, too, but it is&mdash;only thing the right is running, instead of east,
should have read south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is that, sir?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. All right, sir. I will show you. Up here this word "east,"
probably should be "south."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Suppose we change that from "this point running east," and
I will encircle it and put the word "south," and putting my own initial below
the change, and ask you if you <span class="locked">would&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Running east from the door of the jail office to the rail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
on the opposite side, and down a line from this point running south. Yes, sir;
that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, just initial the change then and the word "east," which we
encircled and changed to "south," and Captain Jones and myself are initialling
the change.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than that, do you have any changes that should be made?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Let that stand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then this document which I have identified as Exhibit 5056,
being the report by the FBI, specifically by Agents Edward Mabey and Kenneth
Hughes [spelling] H-u-g-h-e-s, of an interview with you, apparently,
on December 2, 1963, and ask you if you have any corrections to make as to
that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir; there are one or two changes that I would like to
make in that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Let's see. Can I see it just one moment, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. All right. I would like to make the following changes. At the
bottom of page 1, of Exhibit&mdash;that is 5056, I believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. The last sentence that reads, "Jones assisted in holding back
the press line during the process, and gave instructions to all officers near the
jail office and the door to allow no one in the area from the jail to the automobile,
down the route the prisoner was to take."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what is your comment?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. The comment is that the sentence should have read, "Jones
assisted holding back the press lines through the process of moving the automobile
onto the ramp." The rest of the sentence refers back to just prior to
that when the instructions had been given to keep those things clear. Immediately
following the clearing of the jail office is when I gave those instructions
at that time, to hold the people back and get those&mdash;I did not have time
or the opportunity, and did not turn at that time and tell everybody that we were
trying to get the car back up into position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any change or comments to make upon the document&mdash;5056?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir; on page 2, of this same exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, back on the record.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Beginning with the first complete paragraph that says, "Jones
was walking up the Commerce Street ramp when he heard from behind him,
'Here he comes,' from an unidentified individual," and on that, there is only
one change.</p>

<p>Whereas, Jones was walking toward the Commerce Street ramp instead of up
it, now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you were <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. In other words, I was not up on the rise itself. I was walking
toward it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Heading from what direction?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. From the general area in front of the jail office door, out in
the flat area. The ramps come down like [indicating] straighten out. The
jail is here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, what you wish to point out is that the Commerce
Street ramp takes an upturn about half way up the ramp?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that you want to indicate that you had not reached the
up-rise?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you were in the ramp that runs between Main and Commerce,
but on the level part?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. On the level part, and walking toward the rise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Walking toward the rise. Any other comments concerning
that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir; on page <span class="locked">3&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 5056?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. 5056.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What paragraph?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. It will be the last sentence; begins on page 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; the last sentence beginning on page 2. Will you read
it then?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. "Jones then placed two officers at the swinging door just outside
the jail office, and advised them not to let persons leave who had proper
<span class="locked">identification&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Latter part of that sentence is at the top of page 3, of that
Exhibit 5056, is that right?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir. The correction, sir, that is "Jones then placed two
officers at the swinging doors just outside the jail office and advised them to
let the reporters and news media who had identification come to the third
floor."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than that change, that sentence, you think, is correct?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. That's correct, yes, sir. Now, I have one more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. What page?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. It is the last paragraph of page 3, first sentence that <span class="locked">reads&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are talking about Exhibit 5056?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>"Due to the fact that Jones was recalled from vacation, he wasn't present at
any briefing on the security measures that were to be in effect in the basement
on November 24, 1963."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Now, on that, I had been due to go on vacation on Friday. I
had continued on through. I don't know why I wasn't in on any briefing or
anything. I am going to say that is the reason I wasn't, for I was down
there, and that was, I'm sure&mdash;I have told the gentlemen these facts and so
forth, but that I didn't attend a briefing, that I had planned to go on vacation
immediately after the President's speech at the the Trade Mart, and&mdash;but I can't
say why I wasn't called in on any briefing. I just wasn't in on any of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just while we are on that subject, is it a fact that you were
supposed to go on a leave as soon as the President left Dallas?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. On Friday; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On Friday?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In fact, did you go?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state very briefly for me your activities from the time
of the night before the President's visit up until the 24th? Just very briefly.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. All right, sir. I had been assigned previously in the week
to have charge of the fourth floor at the Trade Mart where the President's
luncheon was to be held. On Thursday night <span class="locked">before&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wait. Thursday night?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Thursday night before the luncheon. I was rather wakeful
and a little nervous, certainly not anticipating an assassination, but because of
some unfortunate incidents in Dallas, there was a desire not to have anything
happen that would reflect on the city, and certainly even a humiliating incident
such as throwing paper, eggs, or shouting or anything such as that. A little
apprehensive about it, and didn't sleep very much. Went out to the Trade
Mart on Friday and stationed quite a few officers at all the places on the fourth
floor.</p>

<p>I had a listing and a schedule and all that. Remained there until afternoon&mdash;that
is, after news of the assassination, and until we were told that we could
leave. I then returned to the city hall and en route had cleared with the dispatcher
that if he didn't have further instructions for the group with me that
we would return to the city hall.</p>

<p>I returned, and I immediately made every officer available to Captain Fritz.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
I don't know how long that we worked that night for sure, but I do know it was
after 2 o'clock when the FBI Agent Vince Drain left the city hall with some&mdash;some
evidence he was going to take, and that was about 2 o'clock, Saturday
morning, the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go <span class="locked">home&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, I did go home for possibly 2 to 3 hours and laid down.
Didn't rest very much. We came back down Saturday and continued working
with Captain Fritz. Making my offices available and my men available to him
during the day Saturday until Saturday evening when we filed our&mdash;our bureau
filed the assault to murder charge on Oswald for the shooting of Governor Connally,
which is our bureau that, assault to murder&mdash;that handles assault to
murder.</p>

<p>Captain Fritz' bureau handles murder, and by this time I&mdash;that was filed, I
began to help take incoming calls and to assist in any way that I could up there
in the administration offices. Stayed up there until at least nearly midnight
Saturday night. Went home, got a few hours of troubled sleep that night.
Before I left, Chief Stevenson told me that it looked like my cases were all
filed, everything was in pretty good shape. I might as well go ahead and take my
vacation as I had planned and I told him I couldn't enjoy&mdash;a little fishing trip
was what I had planned&mdash;until it was all over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me go back a moment. There was a lineup of some kind on
the night of Friday, November 22, at which Oswald was brought into the lineup
in the assembly room at the police department, at which a number of news
media were present.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you present that night?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No, sir; I was on the third floor at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I have known him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just state how well and under what circumstances.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir; I will be glad to do that. And I do want to ask&mdash;can
I say something off the record here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Get back on the record.</p>

<p>During the off-the-record period, Captain Jones simply explained to me that
he had omitted something from his comments relative to what?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Relative to knowing Jack Ruby. I've got to <span class="locked">find&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Relative to what document?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. 5056. Document 5056; that would be the first complete paragraph
on page 3, where it states, "Jones states that he did know Ruby and had
known him prior to 1952, when he ran the Silver Spur, a nightclub on South
Central. He stated that prior to 1952, he was a lieutenant covering this district
and did go into the Silver Spur, at the most, six times looking for white subjects."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state your comments on that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. The comment is that, "Jones stated that he did know Ruby
and had known him prior to 1952, when he ran the Silver Spur, a nightclub
on South Ervay." The next sentence should read, "He stated that prior to 1952,
he was a detective assigned mostly to colored cases, but that occasionally we
were assigned cases involving white suspects, and on a few occasions did go in
the Silver Spur during those investigations."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I was asked how many times, and I could not estimate how
many times. I said, "Not over six times, probably, altogether."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me put it this way to you. Did you know him well enough
so that you would have recognized him had he walked into a room?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. That is a question in my mind that I doubt very much that
I would have. I did recognize him in the basement after someone said&mdash;before
I ever saw who it ever was in custody, that it was Jack Ruby, and when I was
told that in advance I did recognize him. Otherwise, it is possible that I
might have recognized him had I been given that opportunity but I did not have
the opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him, that is to say, Jack Ruby, in your rounds of
the basement any time, from the shooting of the President until the shooting of
Oswald?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. To recognize him as such, I did not see him to recognize him
then. And after seeing him at the time of the arrest, I did not recall having
seen him even as a face in the crowd prior to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say that now with the consideration after having
been told that it was Jack Ruby and recognizing him, you still don't remember
having <span class="locked">seen&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I did not see that particular man in there, and not having
recognized him, I don't recall seeing that face, at any time. This is with the
full knowledge that since this matter I have found that one of my own men
filed a simple assault case on him about a year ago, but I wasn't aware of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know of any plans that had been made at that time
for the transportation of Oswald, prior to leaving to go home on Saturday
night, the 23d of November?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. That is one of the questions that I am going to have to say
that things have come up that during my investigation that I headed following
the shooting of Oswald, by Ruby&mdash;that I headed a team of several lieutenants,
and one detective investigating the security in the basement&mdash;and I have some
knowledge as a result of that investigation, that no one came to me and told
me about the possible transfer, or&mdash;possible transfer, or any plans for a transfer
prior to me going home Saturday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you aware that the plan was not to transfer Oswald until
at least 10 o'clock on Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. It seems to me as if possibly there was something about that
in my mind, but I can't tell you where I got it, but there was some talk around
there. I don't know whether the time was 10 o'clock, or 9 o'clock, and since
that time I have talked to people that said, "I don't know," but it does seem to
me that I was under the impression that when I got up Sunday morning that
if I got down there before 9 o'clock, he possibly would not have been transferred
by that time, but so help me, I cannot think&mdash;I cannot say how that I
knew that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me put it to you another way. Were you given any specific
duty to perform or anything relative to the transfer whenever that would take
place?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. You mean prior to that 11 o'clock, when I was sent to the
basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; prior to Saturday night.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to leaving on Saturday <span class="locked">night&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. In fact, I was told that if I wanted to go on my fishing trip,
I could go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, then you got back at what time?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I would say somewhere roughly around 9 o'clock, couldn't
have been much after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do anything between 9 and, say, 10 o'clock?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir; I sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what you did.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I was answering the telephone, and I can't recall specific
things. It was just things that come up that needed doing right then. Getting
<span class="locked">calls&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me ask you the same question I asked about the other
period. Were you given any specific duties to do, or specific functions as to
supervising concerning the transfer of Oswald during this period of 9 to, say, 11
o'clock, or roughly 11 o'clock, on the 24th?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you simply answering the phone?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I came in and started answering the phone, and started doing
whatever appeared necessary for me to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What then happened next?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Well, that went on for almost 2 hours or somewhere near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
that and then at approximately 11 o'clock is when Chief Stevenson came to me,
and I don't know whether he came in from one of the offices. I was in the big
lobby out front of the chief's office, but I came to the double doors where the
secretaries have their desks, and he came to me and told me to go down to
the basement of the city hall, go up the Commerce Street ramp and place
two officers there to assist an armored truck that was en route to be used in
the transfer of Oswald. Have those two officers there assist that truck in
backing down into the basement as far as possible. "I don't know whether it
will go all the way or not," also to take any available detectives on the third
floor to the basement and place them where I thought they might be needed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you follow those instructions?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us in what way you did so?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. All right, sir. I went to the automobile theft bureau, juvenile
bureau, my own forgery bureau and&mdash;burglary and theft bureau, and got any
detectives available to have them report to me at the jail office, and it seems
to me, as I say, as if two or three detectives went with me. I couldn't tell
you how many it was in the elevator going down with me, but&mdash;nor who they
were, but I do know that when we got to the jail office I then asked them to
remain in one place and I went out the door on the ramp, or on the driveway
and up the ramp to Commerce Street, called Patrolman Jez and another officer,
uniformed policeman, then. Relayed Chief Stevenson's instructions not to leave
there that the truck was en route.</p>

<p>In coming back down the ramp I encountered Captain Talbert, who is in
charge of the patrol division, and because Chief Stevenson had sent me down
there to do that, I informed him of the instructions I had so that he wouldn't
inadvertently move them, and then I returned to the officers in the basement&mdash;jail
office, and just standing outside there. And from here on in&mdash;many times&mdash;I
can tell you most of the things that happened. I am sure I may be a little
unsure of the time, or sequence of things, for there in a matter of a few minutes
quite a lot of things were done, but I returned into there and told the officers to
remain there, <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say that you <span class="locked">returned&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. To the jail office on the basement floor. Now, who they were,
I don't know. I am sure some of it is mentioned in the individual officers' reports
that we have, of the ones that were there that I was talking to and told
them as far as I knew the armored car was going, that was going to transfer
him, that was backed up, it was backed up there and we would see the prisoner
was safely escorted over to that. Meantime, someone, I couldn't <span class="locked">tell&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just 1 minute. Before that, had you been told by Chief Stevenson
when he instructed you to go down to the Commerce Street ramp and make
arrangements for the handling of the armored <span class="locked">truck&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been told what route would be followed by the armored
truck, or whatever vehicle?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I had not been told that. I had heard some discussion. We
have a large map of downtown, city of Dallas, that sits inside of the chief's
office where the secretaries sit outside there, and one of the chiefs, I don't
recall which one it was, was over there talking to someone else about a proposed
route. I don't know what it was. I was not told.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Oh, just prior to my going to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, just prior to 11 o'clock?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were discussing what route to take?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Discussing route, and I don't know what arrangements was
made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let's go back into the basement where you left off at the end
of the last sequence of questions. What time, roughly, would it have been
when you had completed the duty of informing the police who were at the
top of the Commerce Street entrance, and after you had informed Captain
Talbert, and after you had gotten these three <span class="locked">men&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. To the jail office there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was it, about?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Well, it would take a minimum, I would say, of 5 minutes,
to come up that. It would vary a little, and possibly more, depending on how
fast the elevators came up and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do next then?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Next thing I did&mdash;it was brought to my attention&mdash;we don't
have a chart here so I will <span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Here; I am going to mark it, "Dallas, Texas, March 24, 1963.
Exhibit 5057, deposition of Capt. O.&nbsp;A. Jones." I am signing my name below
it and I would like you to sign your name, here.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then will you use the exhibit as you see fit. Let me say
to you that if you do refer to the exhibit please indicate in words where it is
rather than pointing to it because it will not make sense later on.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you were saying about the <span class="locked">basement&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. When I got off the elevator, came out and left the elevator&mdash;all
right, now, someone brought it to my attention that photographers and news
media were in this part of the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the jail?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Jail office, outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Outside of the desks?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Outside the booking area, outside of the desk part of the jail
office, and newsmen all out in here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say "here," you are pointing to the jail area?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. The corridor they have from the driveway from the basement
jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the east side of the swinging doors?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. On the east side of the swinging doors; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what did you do?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I did not know the instructions given to the other officers
down there prior to that. Nothing. So, immediately after seeing them&mdash;I
saw Chief Batchelor and Chief Stevenson come out the swinging doors into the
area, and Batchelor, being the highest ranking officer present, I pointed these
people out to him, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, in the jail office?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. In the jail office&mdash;were they supposed to be in there, and
wouldn't it be better, if we could get those people out of the jail office, that it
would be easier to watch the prisoner, and so, I don't know the exact words,
I used, and they walked around and looked around, and then agreed that it
would be. So, he and I, and at least one other officer, and I don't know who
he was, but at least one more removed everyone out of the outer part of the
jail office to just outside the swinging doors coming from the basement of the
city hall going east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the <span class="locked">direction&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. In the direction of the driveway, and after getting them out
there, not knowing the specific instructions that might have been given I said,
"Chief Batchelor, would it be possible to have all this media be placed north
of a line from the east corner of the jail office&mdash;all right. To move all the news
media north of a line formed from the corner of the jail office from the corridor
to across the ramp leading down from Main Street, to have all reporters north
of that line, and that east of a line running off from this point across the
driveway going south down to the exit from the basement parking area."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, I am going to mark, as you have indicated on the
map, by making a line starting&mdash;with the letter "A" on the corner formed
by the intersection of the jail corridor and the basement ramp moving east to
a point, "B", which I am <span class="locked">marking&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which is the east side of the ramp, and to another point marked
"C".</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Well, now, actually, that line would extend all the way up
here at that time. I meant to keep them back on those two&mdash;and in <span class="locked">order&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Am I correct in what your suggestion was that the news media
should be kept north of the line marked A and B?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And east of the line which runs "B to C," the point "C"?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I didn't spell it out in those details, but that is the general
idea, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. "B" being the top of the Commerce Street ramp?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. For this reason, that we would have only two sides to watch.
The rest of it would be more or less brick wall, and he agreed to that. The
officers were stationed previously by other people along these lines, so, I went
out there with some of these officers and I don't know how many, and we did get
those people back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You got them back?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. We got them back fairly well at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Behind the lines?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Behind these lines. In fact, there at one time it was completely
clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would have been how long before Oswald came down?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. There again, I couldn't say. It was a matter of a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell me how many people were in the area that I am
marking with a pen, "Area A"?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I cannot tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which is to say, the area north of the line "A", which you recently
drew?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Mr. Hubert, that would be truly a guess on my part along with
knowledge obtained later and watching these TV films. Unconsciously, I would
have to use that, for I don't have any idea on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were they standing shoulder to shoulder across the ramp?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. It wasn't when we first pushed them back there, it was possibly
six or eight people, and possibly a few more than that including officers. I
didn't stop to&mdash;told the officers, "Get them back," "get them back."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am talking about an area called "B", can you give me
any comment as to how many people roughly were in there?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I couldn't guess. A few minutes later I can tell you there was
quite a few people there, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We'll get to there. Suppose we get to that. Now then, at the
time Oswald was brought down, can you tell me how many people, roughly, were
in Area "A" and Area "B"?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No, sir; I find myself with figures there that&mdash;that I do not
know whether they are right or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. What I would want to say, that I did see several people, and
I was up there personally, and I don't know exactly who they were, but I was
attempting to push them back at that time. So, we can get to that any minute,
but as far as giving you a figure or definite number or something, I couldn't do
it with any degree of accuracy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Do you know of your own knowledge what procedures
were being used for checking people in that whole downstairs or basement
area, including the ramp and so forth?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I know only one instance of&mdash;somewhere on the way down
there that morning, whether it was up on the third floor or whether&mdash;I believe
it was off of the elevator, just coming off of the elevator I was asked for an
identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were in civilian clothes?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I was in civilian clothes, yes, sir. I was asked, and that is
the only time. I did not give the instruction. These officers were placed there
prior to that, on the outside lines, and I don't know of my own knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, then, proceed with the chronological sequence.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. The chronological sequence, after getting these people out of
the jail office and out of the corridors and driveway to these two points of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
we were speaking, then I was somewhere just south of this point marked "B"
on the driveway when Chief Stevenson approached me and said, "There has been
a change in plan. We are going to put two cars on the driveway and use them."
Now, sometime in between there, and I can't tell you the exact time I am aware
of a blur of a car going out the wrong way. I didn't see who was in it, and I
didn't take too much awareness of it. I don't know just when it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say, "going the wrong way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I mean it came out of the basement area and headed up toward
Main Street which ordinarily is the down ramp and you go out the ramp going
up Commerce Street. There was a car out there, and in light of the investigation
I know the circumstances now, but at that time I couldn't tell you about
that one which did go out. Chief Stevenson said&mdash;came to me just before or
after the car pulled out and said&mdash;said there was a change in plans, "We are
going to put two cars in the driveway and transfer him in a car." Almost immediately
some cars started up back in this area [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say "this area," that is the basement?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. All right, the parking area of the basement, east of the driveway,
and I am very sure one car that I saw pull up and go up the Commerce
Street ramp from a ways, and I think I am aware of a second car pulling up
behind. Now, the second car was having a little difficulty backing down into
position to where it would&mdash;where it should go, so that when I stepped forward
and became aware of quite a mass of people, I couldn't tell you how many in this
area "B".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were standing in the west side of the area?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir; the west side of area B, but the east side of the ramp.
I was somewhere in there, and I attempted to push the people back, and I'm
afraid I may have delayed the driver by pushing these people back, but along
about that time someone shouts, "Here he comes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you just make a little circle as to where approximately
you were?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I think&mdash;I think&mdash;I think I was somewhere right in this area
here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just put a circle.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Well, I don't know. That is as close as I can put it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have drawn a circle, and I'm just going to put here, as you
said, that it was somewhere around in here, around in the circle that you have
drawn and I am marking that "approximate position of Capt. O.&nbsp;A. Jones
at the time that Jones heard someone say 'Here he comes,'" is that correct, sir?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, actually, there was an automobile, as you say, backing up
towards east, right?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But when they <span class="locked">begin&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. It would have been backing north attempting to back north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Backing north, but with the front of the car facing south?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Now then; from here is something that was a mystery to me
for 2 <span class="locked">weeks&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't answer the question.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. That's true. In the basement area, onto the ramp, heading
out towards Commerce, and attempting to back toward north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you say there was something else?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. The police vehicle&mdash;car is ahead of me a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is what?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Ahead of me, backing toward it, and I am probably in the
way, and when they shout, "Here he comes," and the line up ahead of me&mdash;up
toward the Commerce Street ramp, and I know of some officers, Chief
Stevenson and Chief Batchelor, uniformed men up at the ramp, but I'm not
sure about Captain Talbert. I'm sure, I believe he is ahead of me. Quite a few
officers, however, someone yells, "Here he comes," there is a big furor, so then
as I turned and looked back into this area "B", there are some people in there
which&mdash;hands out, looking them, completely. I am looking east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are looking away from <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. From the approximate point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you are also looking away from the point which Oswald
exited?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. That's right. In watching the people, I was aware, in fact,
in trying to get them out of the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it be correct to say that the televisions were to your
left?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I think so. I mean, that is my impression, and I cannot&mdash;I
couldn't swear. I can give you the impression to the best of my knowledge,
but here is one thing that I know. I am in that area, I think the television
is to my left. I turned to make sure the people stay out of way. Some of the
previous instructions&mdash;can I go back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Some of the previous instructions that I had given to this
officer here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Here?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I'm sorry, just outside of the swinging doors leading into
the basement of the city hall and just after clearing the jail office of the
reporters, just keep the people out of the area. I told both the officers and
the newsmen there, "When the prisoner comes down, you will not be allowed
in this area. You will not be allowed to step forward to take pictures, or
converse with the prisoner."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You gave that instruction?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I gave this instruction to them. I can't say to this officer,
or to that officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Things had changed. First, I was under the impression that
the armored car would back all the way down. I didn't know whether it
could get all the way down, may do it at some intermediate point. If it comes
all the way down there would be a line. That was the&mdash;that was where I
wanted the officer here coming out of the jail office. The door of the vehicle
that <span class="locked">opens&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I say, that was your idea?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. It was my idea, if the transporting vehicle backs all the way
to the jail door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. If it comes partially down here and has to stop, which would
be somewhere around this area here [indicating], the&mdash;just past&mdash;just at the
point where the ramp starts to rise there is a beam, I believe, or low point
in the ceiling there, that if it cannot get to that point these officers in the line
here can form an <b>L</b>-shaped line around the prisoner, between them and the
two sides where the news media had been told to stay and form a buffer in
between to walk up there. Then the change&mdash;going to put two cars up there.
There is no reason why that back car can't get all the way back to the jail
office. The original plan would be that the line of officers would be from the
jail door to the vehicle. Then they say, "Here he comes," and I am off up
here, to the point that I indicated on the map. It is too late to get the people
out of the way of the car and form the line. I am aware that Oswald is already
coming because of the furor, so, I was trying to keep everybody out of the
way and keep the way clear and I heard a shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. And I place that as to why it is my last awareness of&mdash;the
back car is ahead of, towards Commerce Street. The prisoner is coming from
back here [indicating]. The car is backing like this [indicating]. I am
looking <span class="locked">at&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were looking at the automobile?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. At the automobile. They say, "Here he comes." I turned
and these people back this <span class="locked">way&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Looking away from the direction?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Into this basement parking area. I heard a shot, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
distinctly remember looking over my left shoulder and behind me to the scene
of the scuffle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you see?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Just mass confusion of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; let me ask you this; had you at any time seen Ruby
in the basement?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the time of the shooting, did you see him?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Not at the moment of the shooting. I was looking out into
the basement area, parking area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After the shooting, did you see him?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I did; after he was in custody and on his feet and just prior
to them taking him into the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize him then?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. At that time, after having someone say it was Jack Ruby,
then I did recognize him as Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear him say anything?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No, sir; in fact, I wasn't that close to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have anything more to do with Ruby? Did you see
him after that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Can I continue on the chronological thing there? I don't
believe I did see <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. It will be just about that same thing that after I turned
and looking back, and also someone running out to the street, out at the extreme
edges of the crowd and all, and that is when I hollered, "Block the exits." Or
"bar the exits," or "don't let anybody out." Or&mdash;I couldn't tell you the words
I used. I shouted over my shoulder and took a few running steps and shouting
to the officers, for some of them was running down towards the scene that I
yelled, "Block the exits, don't let anybody out." The two or three officers
stopped. I couldn't tell you who they are, and then I turned and went back
down to the scene or near the scene of the shooting, somebody says, it was
Jack Ruby. In fact, it was said more than once. I heard the words&mdash;and
they got the man standing up. I can see his head and I do recognize in my
mind that it is Jack Ruby, but&mdash;about to get him in the jail office, shouted to
that officer that way, whether he heard me or not, I don't know, but this man
here Lieutenant Swain [indicating] was having a lot of difficulty. He was
standing between point "B" on the driveway and this circle, approximately.
Standing near the television cameras, and having difficulty keeping the television
men from getting down in the driveway. So I stopped there and I assisted
him in keeping those people back for a few minutes until we can get it cleared
up. We get that more or less under control. The people are not trying to
force their way in there, and I go into the jail office and see Oswald lying
on the floor with a bullet hole in the left side, upper rib cage, it appears to me.
His shirt has been pulled up. Whether, at that time Ruby was still in the
jail office or had started upstairs, he&mdash;it seems to me possibly he was getting
on the elevator, but I can't say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you speak to Ruby at that time?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I did not speak to Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. There&mdash;if that was him getting on the elevator, or if he was
in there. After that, no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you have anything to do with the clearing of the
basement area at an earlier time?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you ever told as to what the original route would be
from the police department to the county jail?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I was never told by some officer coming to me and saying,
this is the route. As I said, I heard some of the higher ranking officers talking
of a possible route, but I was on a long-distance phone call at a desk nearby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you can say to me now that you really did not know the
planned route?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I was not told, and I do not know for sure what route they
were going to take. I was aware of talk and some routing being planned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us when you first heard that Ruby was supposed
to have come down the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I don't remember; I don't understand that question, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me put it this way; you have heard since that Ruby claims
that he came down the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember when you first heard that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. When I first heard that it was probably as a result of me
being in charge for the Police Department Committee investigating the operational
security about that transfer, and why it broke down, and that heading
that committee, I am sure that was passed to me by some of the officers who
had talked to him following his arrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, later, on the date of the 24th, or could it have
been later than that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. If I heard it prior to that, or heard rumors, the first official
knowledge that I do have would have been even following Thanksgiving Day,
for that is the time I was called back from the vacation and called from
vacation to head that investigation, and it was subsequent to that that we had
our investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that if you heard anything about Ruby's version of how
he got there, it would have been just passed on to you prior to going on your
vacation? That is to say, you would have heard it from <span class="locked">someone&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I would have heard it&mdash;or put out on the radio or newspapers
or some source like that. I could have read that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you go on vacation?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I left <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Dallas?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I left Dallas about 7:30 on Thanksgiving morning and got
back in town at 8 o'clock that night. Drove to Shreveport, spent 4 or 5 hours
with my father and ate lunch and came back. They called for me by the time
I got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were not on the special committee to investigate security
until that time?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. When I returned, went to Chief Stevenson's house that night.
He told me what they had in mind. I reported for that the morning following
Thanksgiving, Friday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Captain, is there anything else you want to state concerning
the facts, in your deposition this morning?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I can think of no other at this time, Mr. Hubert. I only wish
there was some definite facts I could give you, and wish I could have been more
definite in my answers, but I can think of no other right now. We have covered
the situation pretty thoroughly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, have you been interviewed by any member of the Commission,
other than myself?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No, sir; I'm sure I haven't. I mean I would remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean, you have been interviewed by me prior to the commencement
of this deposition, isn't that correct?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. We went over the details briefly a while ago; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was this morning?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. That was this morning; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, can you tell me whether you observed any inconsistencies
between the interview that you had with me this morning and your testimony
in this deposition?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I am not aware of any, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you provided any material information in that interview
with me this morning which has not been talked about in the record of this
deposition today?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I don't know of any, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that is all, sir. Captain, if you have anything else to
<span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I will be happy&mdash;if there is anything that I can say that will
shed some light on the truth, that's what I want, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything at all that you haven't said to me, or during
the interview, or during any statements that you may have made to anybody
which you would like to say now?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I can think of none&mdash;I got&mdash;I told you the facts as I know
them. The book that the Commission has, has a copy of&mdash;has the conclusions
that were reached by our Committee, and those are just opinions based on our
investigation of it and certainly we do have opinion on it but I have tried to
stay away from my opinion, and&mdash;I will answer any questions in the future
that you or any member of your Commission wants to know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much. Let me say that if you should think of
anything that has been omitted please feel free to call upon me or any member
of the Commission staff to convey that information.</p>

<p>Once again I thank you personally and on behalf of the Commission.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just a moment.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me say that I am recommencing this deposition about a
minute after it finished. You are still under the same oath, of course, that you
were before.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that you did prepare, or it was prepared under your
supervision, a chart, or diagram that showed the basement area, and by the use
of circles and identifying code showed the positions of individuals.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir; that was prepared under my direction by an officer
and places people who were not available to our office in this city, where they
were placed by the statements, or statements of people who were nearby and
said they were there. That was to the best of our ability to determine where
they were at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I recall it, that was quite a large chart, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. The original that they made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it showed the positions of people like that by circles in
which numbers <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Were numbered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think you used a color as well?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Color to denote the occupation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whether reserve <span class="locked">officers&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Designated <span class="locked">from&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Newspapermen.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. And those numbers applied to one other, then they applied
to the number of the page in the book of the ones they took affidavits from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say that these circles with the number in it designating
the position of a particular individual, that same number was used to
identify his report?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In your security report?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But note for the record: The report which Captain Jones is
referring has been designated as Commission Report No. 81-A. This is a copy
of that, isn't it?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir. That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. So, that the chart really is an estimation based upon
the persons involved, what they said themselves, and also as to what other
people said as to where they were.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir; we were limited as to the miles and distances of
contacting some of the witnesses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Once again I thank you for appearing.</p>

<h2 id="JR">TESTIMONY OF LT. JACK REVILL</h2>

<p>The testimony of Lt. Jack Revill was taken at 9:15 a.m., on March 31, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Lt. Jack Revill [spelling] R-e-v-i-l-l-e.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No. No "e."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No "e"? But two "l's."</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. My name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff
of the general counsel on the President's Commission. Under the provisions
of Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, joint resolution of
Congress No. 137, in the rules and procedures adopted by the Commission in
conformance with the Executive order and joint resolution, I have been authorized
to take a sworn deposition from you. I state to you now that the general
nature of the Commission's inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate and report upon the
facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent
violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In particular as to you, Lieutenant Revill,
the nature of the inquiry today is to determine what facts you know about the
death of Oswald and any other facts you may know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Now, Lieutenant Revill, you have appeared here today by virtue of a general
request made to Chief Curry by J. Lee Rankin, who is the general counsel of
the Commission. And under the rules of the Commission you are entitled to a
3-day written notice prior to the taking of the deposition, but the rules also
provide that a witness may waive that 3-day written notice. Do you wish to
do so? Do you wish to waive the <span class="locked">3-day&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I will waive it, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, let's swear you.</p>

<p>If you will stand and raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. State your name, please.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. My name is Jack Revill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. My age is 34 years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. My residence is Dallas, Tex., 5617 Meadowick Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation, sir?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I'm employed by the Dallas Police Department, lieutenant
of the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I have been employed by this police department for a period
of 13 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you start?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I was employed and assigned a patrolman. From there
I was promoted to my present rank of lieutenant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you receive your present rank?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. June 26, 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what are your specific functions or duties or assignments
within the department?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I am presently assigned as section supervisor of criminal
intelligence, which is a part of the Special Service Bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been in that section?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Since February of 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is your immediate superior there?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. My immediate supervisor is Capt. W.&nbsp;P. Gannaway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then over him?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Chief Curry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you don't work for any other captain or supervisor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You report to the Chief himself, I mean, you don't go through
Stevenson or Batchelor?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Just directly to the Chief.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I would like you to state briefly, so that we get the full
story, just what function you have had with respect to the investigation of the
shooting of Oswald. First let me ask you: Were you present when Oswald was
shot?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have anything to do with the transfer of Oswald?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty that day?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; later I was, but not the morning of the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Not at the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, then, go ahead and tell us about just what you did with
reference to the investigation of this.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. After Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald I was assigned
to an investigative committee to determine how and why Jack Ruby gained
access to the basement of the city hall. This committee was comprised of myself,
Lt. F.&nbsp;I. Cornwall, Lt. P.&nbsp;G. McCaghren, Lt. C.&nbsp;C. Wallace, Capt. O.&nbsp;A. Jones
and Inspector Sawyer, and I do not recall his initials, but our function was to
interview the people present in the basement on the morning of the shooting, and
any other leads that might be developed from these interviews. We were to
follow up on these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did the official committee you have just mentioned come
into existence and who put it in existence and who gave you your orders?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. This committee was formed&mdash;created at the orders of
Chief J.&nbsp;E. Curry. The exact date I do not recall. It was in December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. As previously stated, our function was to interview these
people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had any other interviews of these people been made prior to
the commencement of the functions of your committee?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Interviews, as such, no. Most of the officers had submitted
written reports as to their specific duties on the morning of November 24,
1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know when that was done?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I presume that it was done on the date of the shooting
and immediately thereafter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn't it a fact, as I recall it, that the individual reports made
by every officer who was in the basement more or less followed a form in the
sense that they were submitted a list of questions, at least they had to answer
that much, and they could, perhaps, go further if they wanted to?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I believe the form letter you make reference to was given
to the police reserve officers. These are the people that I devoted my efforts
toward, the police reserve, but Lieutenant Cornwall and I, our duty was to
interview these reserve policemen.</p>

<p>Lieutenant McCaghren, O. A. Jones and Wallace interviewed the sworn
officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By the way, where is Cornwall now?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He is in Louisville, Ky., at the Southern Police Institute.
He left a week ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I understand that he is going to be <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. 3 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 3 months?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Now, Lieutenant Cornwall and I were together throughout
the existence of this committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you familiar with the document entitled, "Investigation of
the Operation and Security Involved on the Transfer of Lee Harvey Oswald,
on November 24, 1963," which I now show you?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that I am showing Lieutenant Revill, a
document which has been identified as Commission's Report 81-A. Are you
familiar with the letter of transmittal of this report dated December 16th, 1963,
which is at the first part of the report, and runs for 11 pages, signed by Sawyer,
Westbrook, and Jones?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I believe that this report, in its very last paragraph, says that
you have read it and concur?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Some of the reports in there are actually signed by you?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know an officer, a reserve officer by the name of Mayo?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Mayo?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Lamar Mayo. I think his civilian employment is in&mdash;he is an
accountant or chief of credit department of Sears, Roebuck here.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. This is R.&nbsp;L. Mayo?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It could be R. L. Mayo.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I looked here and I found a copy of an interview of a
reserve officer, Sgt. R.&nbsp;L. Mayo, signed by myself and Lieutenant Cornwall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Lamar W.?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. We do have an L.&nbsp;W. Mayo. It is possible that we made
an error on this up here, the <span class="locked">girl&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is L.&nbsp;W. Mayo, I think.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. It will be the same. I was looking at his report, and
what we had put in our report about his position or duty assignment and what
happened here, <span class="locked">they&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say "here," you are talking <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. In the report. It is page 70.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Page 70 of Commission's Document 81-A.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. What happened, the secretary in typing the report put
the wrong initial. She placed R.&nbsp;L. Mayo, and it should read L.&nbsp;W. Mayo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I noticed that you are talking about the part of the letter which
starts off "Re: interview of Reserve Officer, Sgt. R.&nbsp;L. Mayo, 826," that being
a heading on the letter of December 3, 1963, but the next document also numbered
page 70, in Commission's Document 81-A, shows that the initial report
dated November 26, addressed to Chief Curry is signed, "L.&nbsp;W. Mayo," and
it is your thought&mdash;that it is an error in the first document which is entitled,
"Interview of Reserve Officer, Sgt. R.&nbsp;L. Mayo," and it should have been, "L.&nbsp;W.
Mayo.?"</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is your opinion that that is the same person?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; this is my opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that Sergeant Mayo, when he was interviewed by
you stated that he had been approached by some individual who was either
a minister or posing to be a minister in any case, who was trying to get into
the jail through the Commerce Street entrance on November 24, prior to the
shooting, stating that he wanted to see Oswald, and that you had told him,
well, that wasn't pertinent to your inquiry, and all I want to do is ask you
what&mdash;if it is true, and just what comment do you have to make on it?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I don't recall making that, because it would have been
pertinent to my inquiry, because in the reports I make reference to an individual
who was on the street trying to get in who was wearing a Whitehouse&mdash;a
streamer with the words, "Whitehouse Press." This, to me, was pertinent,
and this minister&mdash;of course, the minister wanted to see Oswald prior to the
shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes. In other words, your statement is that you do not recollect
that Mayo made such a statement to you?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; he might have made such a statement, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If he did, your thought would be you would have put it in?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; because to me it would have been pertinent.
Anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall his statement to you, Mayo to you, that after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
shooting when Mayo was stationed in the Main Street ramp that there was
a man who came to Mayo, I think, identified himself as Ruby's roommate, and
was trying to get in to see Ruby, that being after the shooting. Do you recall
that Mayo reported that during the course of the interview?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. It seems like I do recall Mayo saying something like that,
and I believe he referred this man to Lieutenant Gilmore of the Special Service
Bureau. I believe he told me that, but I don't see it here and I don't know
why we omitted that, but I think we&mdash;I do recall him making such a statement.
George Senator, I believe he would have been the individual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes. He described him as having a slight limp, too, I think he
said.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. This, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you do not recall right now why it was not made a part
of the interview?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Just an oversight on my part. It should have been listed
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is one other thing that Mayo states that he told you, which
apparently is not in the report, that is about a man and a woman who had
been hanging around the Main Street entrance apparently after the shooting.
Apparently they were tourists from Springfield, Ill., and they wanted to take
some pictures and stated that to you <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; he did not state this to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As to that episode, then, you do not recall that that was stated
to you?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I would say that he did not relate this to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, as I see the three episodes then, as to the first one regarding
the minister, your thought is that he may have stated to you, but you do not
remember?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor do you recall why he omitted it from your report?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. This might have happened. It was subsequent to this
I found a preacher who wanted to talk to Oswald, and he went to Chief
Batchelor's office, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When subsequent to what?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Subsequent to the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, I see.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, prior to the shooting, and subsequently&mdash;he was probably
talking to&mdash;let's see, he arrived at city hall at 9:30. This preacher's name
is Ray Rushing. He is an evangelist, Radio Evangelist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was reported and the man was interviewed?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. It was not reported because I myself found this man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">But&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. There is no report on it, because it is in&mdash;it had nothing
to do with the shooting. He had gone to Sheriff Decker's office, and Decker
referred him to the city thinking that Oswald had not been transferred, so, he
came to the city hall and went to the third floor, and&mdash;by the way, he rode up
on the elevator with Jack Ruby, <span class="locked">now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This Rushing?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Rode to the third <span class="locked">floor&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Now, he says this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, he says this.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, for the past 7 weeks I have been assigned to the
district attorney's office, the prosecution of Ruby, running down leads and
interviewing witnesses and this preacher was one of the people that we located,
and he related this story to me, that he rode up on the elevator with Jack Ruby
on the morning of November 24. Mr. Wade did not use this man. He didn't
need the testimony, because he had placed Ruby there the morning of the
shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, Rushing says that he rode up with Ruby on
the morning of the 24th, prior to the shooting?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Ray Rushing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't know how we could reach him?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No; he lives in Richardson, Tex.&mdash;correction, please&mdash;Plano,
Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you spell that?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. P-l-a-n-o, north of Richardson, and at this time he does not
have a phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make a report on the interview with him?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; I did not. This was an interview conducted by
the&mdash;at the district attorney's office in the presence of Assistant District Attorney
Alexander.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Rushing say what time that was?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. 9:30. He was sure of the time, because he had let his
wife and family out at the First Baptist Church, and traveled directly to the
city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he sure it was Sunday the 24th?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; he had gone there to speak to Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did he recognize Ruby? Did he say?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He said he recognized him from the newspaper article
that appeared that day, and later days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say whether he had any conversation with him?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He talked about the weather. I asked him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say whether he was&mdash;whether he saw Ruby there
afterwards?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He said he turned to the right and&mdash;went up to the third
floor and after arriving on the third floor, he turned to the right and went to
the administrative office and talked to Chief Assistant Batchelor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, anyhow, after you interviewed this man Rushing, you turned
over the information concerning your interview to Assistant District Attorney
Alexander?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. What I did is, I interviewed Mr. Rushing one night and
asked him if he could come to the district attorney's office and relate this to Mr.
Wade. Possibility that the district attorney might use him as a witness,
and Alexander was of the opinion that the man might be mistaken. That he
saw this as a means of getting publicity. Of course, I disagree with that thinking.
I think that the man is truthful in that he is reporting what he thinks he
saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you interviewed him did he give you what you considered
a fairly accurate description of Ruby?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes. Of course, so many photographs had appeared in
the newspapers and it would be easy for someone <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you interview him?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. At the district attorney's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give you a specific address in Plano?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. It is out in the country. It is a box number. I <span class="locked">can't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is he? A Baptist minister?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He is, yes; I guess he would be. He attends the First
Baptist Church. He is one of these Evangelist&mdash;that his calling is to dry up
the liquor industry, throughout the nation, so they tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he state to you what his purpose was in seeing Oswald?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, he felt that Oswald needed spiritual guidance at
that time. He was in trouble and he felt like he could possibly help him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say whether he got to see Oswald?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He did not get to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say how he got into this building?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He walked into the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any difficulty getting in?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Not at that time, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he state whether he was stopped and asked for identification
by anyone?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; I don't believe he was. At that time, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
I don't know for sure&mdash;I don't know that they were&mdash;had the building secured.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, as to the second thing that Mayo told you. To wit, about
Ruby's roommate who may or may not be Senator, you do recall that he said
that, but you don't know why it was left out of <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. It was an oversight. It seems as though I do recall him
telling me something about that, and that he referred this man to Lieutenant
Gilmore, who was assigned to the special service section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The third thing, that man and wife from Springfield, Ill., you
have no recollection of that?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; no recollection whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall interviewing Pat Dean?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Sergeant Dean? No, sir; I did not interview Sergeant
Dean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or Archer?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; these interviews were conducted by Lieutenant
McCaghren and Wallace. Now, Dean, being a uniformed officer, he might have
been interviewed by Captain Westbrook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your function was to find out how Ruby got into <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Basement. This basement; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first learn of Ruby's version that he came in
the Main Street entrance?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. When I first learned it? I read it in the newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't know it on the 24th?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, actually, you hadn't been assigned the <span class="locked">job&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; no, sir. What happened, my people were&mdash;the
people, the detectives assigned to my unit and myself were assigned to the
Trade Mart, where Mr. Kennedy was to speak. Upon hearing of the shooting,
three of us, or four of us, went to the Texas School Book Depository and
started a systematical search and there were many, many officers present at
that time. I made a report to Chief Lumpkin naming all of the officers that
I could recall being there. This was on a Friday. The following Saturday,
the next day, we were to locate witnesses. People who were employed at the
School Book Depository, get them and bring them to Captain Fritz' office.
This took all day. Saturday night we terminated and went home approximately
8 o'clock. The next morning none of us were assigned to duty. Now, by that
I mean the intelligence unit. I was at home and I saw the shooting on television
and from there I got a phone call to report to Mayor Cabell's home, because
there had been a threat on his life. I went to Washington with Mr. Cabell that
night and got back the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You haven't, then, spoken to Dean at all about how Ruby got
into the basement or how Ruby, says he got into the basement?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I am sure I have discussed it with him, but as far as a
formal interview; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, in any case, your first knowledge didn't come from any
particular individual, but from the newspaper?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In your discussion with Dean, do you recall whether he stated
to you how he found out about Ruby's alleged entry through the Main Street
ramp?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the reserve officer by the name of Holly?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Holly? Yes, sir; I talked to Mr. Holly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall the nature of the conversation?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you tell us about it, please?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. If I may find the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is an index there.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes; and they are filed alphabetically. Ordinarily I can
find it probably easier this way. Holly, yes, Holly was interviewed and he
stated that he had been assigned to a traffic corner and after the shooting
occurred he was reassigned to Parkland Hospital, and that while there some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
unknown police reservist told him that he had observed, or admitted Ruby into
the basement of the city hall, and that Ruby had presented press credentials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Well, what we did, we have photographs of all of the police
reserve, and Holly could not identify anyone as being this officer, or reserve
officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did this take place, that is to say, where was Holly shown
these pictures?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. In the city hall, in the special services bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you say that when Holly was interviewed he was interviewed
by Captain Solomon?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Well, Holly was interviewed by Captain Solomon, and both
Lieutenant Cornwall and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All at once?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No; see what happened, Holly came to us with his story.
Well, we jumped on it because there might be something to it, so I called Captain
Solomon, who has access to all of the records and photographs of the reserve
officers, and he brought them to the special services bureau in the city hall.
Holly was unable to identify this officer. We talked to Captain Arnett, who is a
reserve captain, and both Solomon and Arnett were of the opinion that Holly
might be fabricating this thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now; what did Holly <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. <span class="locked">Holly&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That this reserve officer told him?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. That he had seen Ruby in the basement of the city hall,
and that Ruby had presented press credentials to someone in the basement of the
city hall. We were never able to locate this reserve officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Holly tell you that a reserve officer, possibly the same one,
possibly another, had told him that he had seen Ruby coming down the ramp,
Main Street ramp, and just about a minute before the shooting?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; Holly did not say that to me. I found a reserve
officer who was present in the basement of the city hall who saw some individual
coming down the ramp, the Main Street ramp.</p>

<p>He could not identify this person as being Ruby. As you said, approximately
a minute or minute and a half after the shooting&mdash;I mean, prior to the shooting.
Have you got <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don't want to suggest anything to you, but to assist you, tell
me if you don't recognize the name, Officer Newman?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I believe that it is Newman. I can show you. You&mdash;he
was <span class="locked">assigned&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you interview Newman?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Newman said that he had not recognized Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes; he did not recognize the man coming down the ramp,
and the distance involved, I can readily see why he could not identify him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Newman mention to you in your interview that as a matter
of fact, there were two people he saw in the basement area. One, a man coming
down the ramp about a minute before the shooting, and another person who
jumped the rail down there from the parking area into the ramp on the Main
Street side, but that he could not identify either?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that, as to the man jumping the rail he didn't know whether
it was before the shooting or after.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. The man that he is making reference to jumping over the
rail was an electrician, and this was prior to the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was this Chabot? [Spelling] C-h-a-b-o-t?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Tommy Chabot, I believe he is a mechanic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he, Newman, identify him as such?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Newman did not identify him as such, nor did he identify
the man running down the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I can understand then that when he saw the man running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
down the ramp he did not know who that was, but did he tell you later he
identified that man as being Ruby by comparing him to the pictures?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when Holly was asked to pick out the reserve officer who
had told him what you said he did in the hospital, was Captain Solomon present?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes; Solomon was present and had brought these photographs
to special services bureau, and he was unable to identify any of these
people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn't pick out any picture at all?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You know, of your own knowledge, whether or not Solomon had
another interview with this man?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever heard that Holly actually did pick out a picture
in an interview with Solomon and state that he thought that was the reserve
officer who had spoken to him. Now, apparently that didn't happen when you
were present?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; I don't recall this happening in my presence. I
do recall, I believe, Holly thinking that a specific officer was the individual that&mdash;we
interviewed this officer and he was not the one, and I couldn't tell you his
name, because we talked to so many of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then Holly did say that he thought that this might be the individual,
and he picked out then a particular picture?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. As I recall, he picked out a picture, and as it turned out,
the man that he picked out wasn't even present at the basement of the city hall.
He had been fishing, was on a fishing trip, and I talked to this reserve officer, I
couldn't tell you his name. There were two of them that came from Arlington
directly to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, in any case, it wasn't Newman?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; he was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Newman is a reserve officer?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, the picture Holly picked out as being possibly the man who
told him about seeing someone coming through with a pass or something like
that sort was not Newman?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That reserve officer was interviewed?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; he was interviewed and the report is in here, if I
could find it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your recollection of the interview was that he wasn't even
in the place at all?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He had been fishing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have no recollection at all of Holly picking out Newman's
picture?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; he did not pick out Newman's picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, in <span class="locked">your&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. In my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor, have you heard that he picked out Newman's picture when
you were not there?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; I have not heard this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think the report indicates that you interviewed Ruby?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; on two occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the first one?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. The first occasion, the date would have been on the Sunday
following the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When? One week later?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. One week later, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I can show you a calendar <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I can give you the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you do so?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Would have been on December the 1st in the county jail.
Present at that interview was Lieutenant Cornwall, a jailer, whose name I do
not recall. This man was present at both interviews, at Mr. Decker's request.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The jailer was?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. The jailer; yes, sir. And this proposed interview took
place just outside the cell where Ruby was confined in, I believe it would be the
chief jailer's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you tell us about what happened?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; Lieutenant Cornwall and I, after interviewing
all these people, trying to determine how Ruby got into the basement, decided
that the best thing was to talk to Ruby himself, so, we finally got clearance to
go talk to him and we did, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, by that time you had already heard from the press that he
had said that he had come through the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Something to the effect that, "You may not believe me,
but I walked down the ramp." Anyway at the interview, Ruby was there with
Cornwall and I, and this unknown jailer, and he refused to disclose how he
gained access into the basement stating that this is a part of his defense, so,
we then had Sheriff Decker call Tom Howard, who was representing Ruby at
that time as a legal counsel. Mr. Howard came to the jail and was present
throughout the interview. Ruby was very precise as to his activities on Friday,
the date of the shooting of President Kennedy. He refused to discuss with us
any of his activities on Saturday, November 23 or November 24, the day of the
shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give you any reason?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. This was part of his defense, so he stated. The interview
approximately took 45 minutes. It was a lot <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask him specifically whether the story in the press, that
he had come through the Main Street entrance, was correct or not correct?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; I asked him this, and he refused to discuss it. He
said that he did not want to get anyone in trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you pursue that?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes; I did. I was assigned to this committee to find out
what happened and I really wasn't concerned who we got in trouble, because
if someone was wrong, then they suffer the consequences and I asked him about
officers by name who were present in the basement, if they had seen him or
talked to him, and he wouldn't discuss it. Knowing Jack Ruby, Jack Ruby is the
type of individual that can't be anywhere for a period of time without talking to
someone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you mention to him specifically Roy Vaughn's name?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; the <span class="locked">officer&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the Main Street exit?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He made no comment?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; he wouldn't discuss this. I asked him about Detective
Harrison. The films showed that Ruby was standing at Harrison's
shoulder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say about that?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He became very upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did&mdash;describe how he was upset?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. This is when he said&mdash;well, he got real angry at me and
cussed me and told <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ruby did?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Oh, yes; told me I was a hatchet man and trying to get the
man's job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When he said you were trying to get the man's job, that is
Harrison's job?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He meant Harrison's job, so, what I did, was later got it
approved to put Harrison on the polygraph to determine if he had seen Ruby
prior to the shooting and if he had talked to Ruby. Well, the polygraph examination
showed that Harrison had no knowledge of Ruby being present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you interview Harrison, too?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes; I did. Showed him the film.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you sort of put him through any cross examination?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your opinion of his veracity? Do you think he is
telling the truth?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. If you believe a polygraph examination; he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I was interested in your impression.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; and if this is being recorded, then I'd rather
not state an opinion as to his truth and veracity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand. Did you mention on that first occasion any other
names to Ruby? I think you have mentioned already, Vaughn <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I mentioned the officers who were in the positions to have
seen Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you mention to him the name of Daniels, ex-police officer?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I may have. I might have asked him if he knew Daniels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, in any case, that is all of your questions. He refused to
discuss and at this time he&mdash;his lawyer wasn't present?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. On the second interview, which would have occurred on
December <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before you leave that, I want to get a little bit more information
concerning this, I think you said, "Fit of anger," when he cursed you and
told you you were a hatchet man.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. What upset <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say any other things?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. What upset him was that I was involved in this thing.
When I walked in he said something to the effect, "Well, the Intelligence people
are involved in it now. They think I am a Communist." I don't know what
gave him that idea, but I have known Jack Ruby since 1953. I have never been
a friend with him. I knew him enough to talk to him. Lieutenant Cornwall
took the position of being his friend, and I was the foe, and that is the way we
conducted our interview. We were unable to get any information from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But the mention of Harrison, apparently is the thing that
<span class="locked">set&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Set him off, and I have never been satisfied, personally,
with Harrison's statement. Of course, this is my personal opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that kind of answers the other question.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes; it does. They were reluctant&mdash;I say, "They," the
other members of the committee were reluctant to have him submitted to a
polygraph examination, but I thought that this was one way of determining
if he was truthful or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was as a result of your insistence that he was put under
one?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, perhaps we can go to the second interview. On what
date was that?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. This would have occurred on the 3d of December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tuesday?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. On a Tuesday, yes, sir. The afternoon of December 3.
What we had been attempting to do was to put Jack Ruby on a polygraph
machine, and his lawyer, Tom Howard, had been approached during the first
interview as to doing this. He stated that there were other lawyers coming
into the case and that he would have to have their permission before agreeing
to let Jack take this examination.</p>

<p>On Monday we communicated with Tom by telephone and he kept hedging
with us, and telling us he had not heard from the other lawyers. By "Tom,"
I mean Tom Howard, the lawyer. On Tuesday, we discussed it again with him
and he stated that he was still trying to work this thing out. So, Cornwall
and I again decided&mdash;that we would go directly to Jack Ruby. He was the
person involved, and we would give him the opportunity to submit to the
examination. If he wanted to, fine. If he doesn't want to then it's also fine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
So, we went to Jack on the 2d&mdash;on the 3d of December and gave him the
opportunity to take the polygraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, you asked him?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Asked him, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was his lawyer present then?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Not in the beginning. We later called Tom Howard
to the interview so that he could be present, and they refused to have Jack
submitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At first when you asked Jack about going on the polygraph
machine prior to Tom Howard's being present, what did he say?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He said&mdash;during the second interview he said that his
lawyer would have <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then his lawyer came <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. They declined.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk about the basement?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Tried to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the result of that?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. And again, this was part of their defense, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he show any anger at you then?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes; I think it was a carryover from the first interview,
but this was a strategy that we used. Let him be angry with me, thinking
maybe that he might tell us something, but he never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you mention Harrison's name on the second interview?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I possibly did, but at this time he was more composed,
and there was no&mdash;I don't recall any outbursts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather that the second interview was not fruitful, in that
<span class="locked">nothing&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No information was gathered?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Neither interview was fruitful, other than from his
outburst. It led me to believe that possibly he had talked to some officer, or
had been seen by some officer prior to the shooting, but I was never able to
confirm this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the time you saw Ruby, I take it you had not interviewed
this man, Ray Rushing?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And didn't know anything about it?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By the way, how did you find out about it?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ray Rushing called you?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes; I had assisted him, oh, approximately a year ago
on a problem he was having with one of his preachers. He has got several
preachers in his employment, and it was&mdash;involved a theft, and I was able to
assist him, and he called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What date, about?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. When he called me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. It was during the trial. During the picking of the
jurors. The specific date, I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anyhow, he came in and you interviewed him and made a verbal
report to Alexander.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Oh, Alexander was present at the interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether the result of that interview was passed
to the FBI or to any Government agencies?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor is there a written report?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; no written report. Rushing was reluctant to
take the stand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say why?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, he did. Because of his fight with the liquor industry
they would use this to fight him with. Any publicity they might get of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
derogatory nature would hurt him. We tried to emphasize the point that this
would not be derogatory publicity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you point out to him that the position was somewhat inconsistent
with the fact that he was a volunteer?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He decided he would testify if his testimony was needed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his statement as to his original motivation for reporting
this matter, that is to say, that he had seen Ruby?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I don't believe he ever said what motivated him to report
this incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he ever asked, that you know of, why he had delayed so
long?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; I asked him that myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Well, he used the same story, that he did not want to
become involved in this thing because of his fight or his crusade to dry up
the liquor industry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, how did he then explain the fact that he had volunteered?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. He didn't explain it. Now, this is an assumption on my
part. I believe this is why Mr. Alexander was reluctant to use him, because Mr.
Rushing is the type that there is a Communist under each tree or each rock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old a man is Rushing?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Late forty's, or early fifty's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Has he been in the Dallas area long?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; he had just recently moved to Dallas from South
Dakota. He tells me he is a personal friend of Senator Mundt and the Governor
of South Dakota and other influential people, which may or may not be true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you check to see whether he actually does have a church?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; he is on the radio throughout the Nation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you showed me prior to the commencement of this deposition,
a large folder which you identified as&mdash;which is identified from the title
page of the jacket cover "File No. INT&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. That's intelligence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. "Intelligence 25&mdash;1 through INT&mdash;intelligence 25&mdash;subject Jack
Ruby, DPD," which, I believe means Dallas Police Department. "36398," which
is the jacket, I suppose, and folder of the special services bureau?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Well, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you also advise me that most of this information, or most
of this folder, all except actually the first five pages are reports that have been
built up after the shooting?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; this is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You state to me also, I think, that this jacket has been made
available to the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they make copies of it? Do you know?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. They made copies of much of this information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You dealt with Mr. Sorrels?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Not directly with Mr. Sorrels himself. Some of his agents.
If I might use that, I might be able to explain it more fully. If it is necessary
for the <span class="locked">record&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I was considering making it a part of the record, but I
don't want, obviously, to take it away from you and I don't have authority at
the present time to subpena it.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I will make you copies of anything you want.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what I wanted to get at. If copies have been made
already and turned over to the Secret Service, that would be unnecessary.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. For example, here was toll calls, telephone long-distance
calls placed from the telephone at the Carousel at 1312½ Commerce. The Ruby
residence, at 223 South Ewing, and also the Vegas Club at 3508 Oak Lawn, and
also his sister's residence, Eva Grant's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As of what date?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. These go back to September 24, 1963, through&mdash;correction
on that. Some of them go back to May of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let's deal with it this way, suppose I check to see how
much of this the Secret Service, or the FBI has?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. The FBI has this, because I gave it to them personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The whole thing?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Of this <span class="locked">particular&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Analyses of phone calls?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. The phone calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, dealing with the whole report, suppose we do it this way,
if we find that there is not, in possession of one of the Federal agencies, the
entire record, I may ask you at a later time to make it available for photostating,
or if you could do <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. We can do it. Anything we can do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then what we would do is that you could execute an affidavit
instead of having to come and make a deposition to the effect that the attached
report is true, is a true and correct copy of the originals. I think that is possibly
the best way.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Any way that it is the easiest for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, do you have any other things that you would like to
say?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; I can't think of a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, <span class="locked">now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Wish there was something I could do to shed some light
on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a part of your function to check out all rumors concerning
connections between Ruby and Oswald?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or between Ruby and other groups from the left, right, and
middle of the road, or whatnot?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes; this was our function.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you, in fact, check out those that came to your attention?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. All that came to our attention, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there a special report on that checkout?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. There are many reports. Each lead that came in as a
possible connection, investigation was conducted and a report submitted concerning
that specific rumor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, every rumor was investigated and an individual
report made on it, but they are not collected together anyplace?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; no synopsis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They are not part of this document 81-A? The investigation
that you identified earlier?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think there are copies of these various reports that
could be made available to us?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir; I can make them available to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would appreciate it if you would, because if you have a lot of
that checkout work that would be helpful. How much of a job would it be to
photostat all of those things? Did you turn them over to the FBI?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or any other Federal agent?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Anything that they wanted we gave to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that, but I mean, this mass of documents, as I
gather, are individual reports on individual rumors and so forth, you didn't
turn those over?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a block?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Now, I say we didn't. Let me qualify this, our reports
that we make up, a copy is submitted to Chief Curry daily. Now, what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
does with these reports, I do not know. He may have turned these over to
some Federal agency.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I tell you what I would like for you to do, if you please, is to
find out if they have been turned over to the FBI. I know a lot of rumors
have.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It may be that all that you ran out and reported on they have
too, and therefore, it would be repetition to have them in there, but what we
would be interested in is the copy of the reports and investigation of those
reports or rumors that have not been turned over to the FBI. Now, I wonder
when you could let me know?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Let you know today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. And if they have not, what we will do is pull from our
file copies, and we will make copies available to you of each and every investigation
that we conducted of a connection, or rumor, or connection between
Ruby and Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, make photostatic copies and turn them over
to me.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would appreciate it and just write at the bottom of it, if you
will, and sign it, that this is one of the investigations concerning a rumor,
conducted by you, or whoever it was.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Do you want this as to each individual report, or
collectively?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You would have to initial each individual report so that we
would be sure.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That those are the reports that you referred to in this deposition.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would be very helpful to me. Then you can turn that over
to me and we will make it a part of this deposition. In other words, you
would certify that these reports are the ones that you were talking about during
this deposition, and that to the best of your knowledge, they are correct.
In effect, it will be as though you were here or under oath telling us that that
is correct and that will close the record up. The only other way would be to
have you come here and identify each one and I am trying to avoid <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Let me ask you a question. These reports that we make
reference to were submitted by officers under my supervision.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; well, I see your point.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Will each one of these officers need to initial them, or
can I do this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, we'll have the understanding that this was done under
your supervision, that you can't vouch for the absolute accuracy of every one
of them, but that it is a report made in the course of police department business
and that you and the police department rely upon those reports.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that will be fine. Have you been interviewed by any
member of the Commission's staff by&mdash;prior to the deposition of this morning,
and other than the interview that you and I had just preceding this interview
this morning?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, as to the interview that you and I had this morning before
this deposition began right here in this room have we, in this deposition,
covered all that we talked about in that interview?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there any material information that we talked about in the
interview that has not been brought out in the deposition?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Revill</span>. I do not know of any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's it.</p>

<h2 id="JMS">TESTIMONY OF CAPT. JAMES MAURICE SOLOMON</h2>

<p>The testimony of Capt. James Maurice Solomon was taken at 2 p.m., on March
26, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Capt. J.&nbsp;M. Solomon of the Dallas
Police Department. Captain Solomon, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member
of the advisory staff of the general counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p>Under the provision of Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963,
and the joint resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted
by the Commission, in conformance with that Executive order and joint resolution,
I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you, Captain
Solomon.</p>

<p>I state to you that the general nature of the Commission's inquiry is to ascertain,
evaluate and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In
particular as to you, Captain Solomon, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other
pertinent facts you might know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Captain Solomon, you have appeared today by virtue of a general request
made to Chief Curry by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, who is the general counsel on the
staff of the President's Commission.</p>

<p>Under the rules adopted by the Commission, you are entitled to a 3-day written
notice prior to the taking of your deposition. But the rules also provide that
any witness may waive that 3-day notice if he wishes to do so. Now, I would
like to ask you if you are willing to waive the 3-day notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then; would you please raise your right hand.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your full name, Captain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. James Maurice Solomon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your age, Captain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Fifty-four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. 1502 East Ohio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your present occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. My occupation at the present time at the police department is
reserve coordinator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are a member of the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been a member of the department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Thirty years last September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your particular assignment now is to coordinate the reserve
affairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. My offices are at the police academy, and I am used out there
in training recruits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you in that same position during the period November 22
to 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like you to state for the record just how the reserve program
of the Dallas Police Department is set up, because I don't think we have
it in the record otherwise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Well, I am sure you don't. The reserve operates different in
every city that I know, and just to their particular needs.</p>

<p>Now, the reserve organization in Dallas is strictly what the name implies. It
is, really a reserve intended to be called upon when there is a catastrophe, some
real bad emergency, to augment our manpower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
It is a semimilitary organization in that we call it the reserve platoon. It
has three companies commanded by a captain. Each company has three platoons.
And each platoon has three squads. There are approximately&mdash;it
fluctuates just a little bit&mdash;but there are approximately 300 men in the
organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is the reserve captain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. There are four reserve captains. Now, the reserve major is
Major Tropolis, the major in command. We call him the reserve commander.
He is George Tropolis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who are the captains?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. The captains are J.&nbsp;E. Marks, C.&nbsp;O. Arnett&mdash;I believe you
talked to him last night&mdash;L.&nbsp;C. Crump and O.&nbsp;S. Muller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do these men train at regular intervals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes, sir. They are all required to go through a training program
of about 72 hours. They do that 1 night a week. Takes about 8 months
to complete that before they are used in any way, before they are given a uniform
or anything of that nature.</p>

<p>After they complete this training, they are outfitted with a uniform at their
own expense, and from then on the participation that they do is considered
observation training.</p>

<p>In other words, there is a program set up whereby they report at least two
times a month. We have it set up twice a month, and mandatory that they
come every third month. If they don't we drop them.</p>

<p>But each reserve is required to report at least once a month for observation
training. He can do this in a squad car, in the jail office, or dispatcher's office,
or in any phase of the police operation, really, and he is in uniform, and he works
right alongside the regular officer and just assists him in his work in anything he
wants him to do if he has a belligerent prisoner, but still that is considered
observation training.</p>

<p>Here in the last year or so, we have been using our reserves more maybe like
an auxiliary, but there have been times such as a parade or football parade&mdash;in
other words, it wasn't an extreme emergency, but it was an event that we
realized we needed more manpower, and they were anxious and willing and
eager to help us, and they were being in uniform and were doing a good job.</p>

<p>You want me to continue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do these men get any pay for this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. No. There is no pay at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, they buy their own pistol and uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes. They buy their own initial uniform. After that their
uniforms are maintained with the old uniforms that the regular officers outgrow
or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather from what you have said that you are rather strict as
to the training program that these people must observe, otherwise you drop them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the basic selection of these people? How do you
go about that? What are the criteria you use to select them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. We have just an application form similar to what anybody
would fill out in applying for a job, which is for their background, their schooling,
what type of work they have been engaged in, where they have lived, and
so forth. Then, of course, I submit that application to our personnel bureau
which runs a background check on them, criminal and civil, or any court record
they might have that might show their emotional stability or we run a credit
check on them for bad debts or something like that, that kind of indication
that they are not stable. And traffic arrests.</p>

<p>If it is somebody out of the ordinary, why we are kind of strict along that
score. I have these reserve captains that I just mentioned that comprise the
reserve staff, and each applicant I get after the personnel board submits their
findings, they interview the men, and they have some information to go on there,
and whether he is accepted to go to school. After they interview him and ask
him questions about trying to feel out if they think he is emotionally suited for
that kind of work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What, in your opinion, is it that interests a man to want to be
in the reserve program?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Well, that may be a vocation a little bit. You know, before I
got into the program, I thought maybe it was just a group of people that were
just trying to&mdash;they were just eager, I would say, in other words.</p>

<p>I thought they were, how should I say it, I just felt like they were kind of
overeager, or just nosy, so to speak, and they just wanted to see around. But
after I got into the program, I was amazed to find the caliber of men. I have
only been in 7 years. I went in 1957. It was begun in 1952. And the man
that had it then has since made a promotion to inspector, and I was assigned
out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you have satisfied yourself, I gather, that the
motivation of these people for getting in the reserves is that they consider it a
civic duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. A civic duty, yes, sir; civic minded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is not just that they want the authority of the uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes, sir. Of course, we have applicants like that. It is the
duty of the staff, in a drawn-out process of training, which is really drawn out
8 months, and long enough to observe them, to eliminate the ones they don't feel
are suitable. I nearly always start off with a class of 50 men and I rarely ever
graduate over 30&mdash;27 to 30.</p>

<p>During that period of time some naturally drop out and some I ask to leave,
or just wash out, one way or another, as quickly as I can. After all, it is a
public relations program, and if I understand somebody is in there that I know
will get us in trouble, I find some excuse for him to leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, actually, about 60 percent of the people who start ultimately
get into the program?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you watch their conduct very carefully? On duty, of course
I know, but off duty too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Well, yes. We have had a few occasions where a few got into
some trouble. I guess just drinking or some did get into some bad debts and
embarrass us, but we counseled with them. And I have had to let some go.
Percentagewise this hasn't been much greater than in our regular department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, I want to get to the matter of the interview
you had with Harold Holly, who I think is a reserve officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you state in your own words just what that was all about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Well, Holly was with us a long time. He was in the organization,
I have forgotten how many years, but I don't guess that is important.</p>

<p>But frankly, Holly was&mdash;he is confused. I am not exactly satisfied that he
is sure about what he is saying. His statements were so general, such a general
nature, and when I showed him the pictures he was unable to positively
identify them.</p>

<p>This man that he did pick out and said that he looked most like the man that
was in the basement was W.&nbsp;J. Newman. He was in the basement, but he
wasn't out at Parkland Hospital where he told them he saw him, and I just
got the impression that Holly was&mdash;he just wasn't too reliable a witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say to you? Of course, we will get his testimony,
but what do you remember that Holly said to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Well, he first approached me&mdash;you see, I was at the courthouse
down in the area when Oswald was shot, so I knew immediately from the previous
slaying that one of our big headaches was going to be at the Parkland
Hospital, and I rushed on out there to try to set up a little security out there.
And Holly showed up out there after awhile, and he made the statement to me
that he thinks he knew a man&mdash;that is the way he put it, that he thought he
saw one of the men out there that was in the basement of the city hall who
knew something about that. And I said, "Who was it," and he said, "I couldn't
tell you, but I would know him if I saw him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say the man was in uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes; he said he saw him out there at Parkland Hospital, so I
tried to check.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This was told you at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes; this afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he indicate that he thought he was a reserve officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is why he told it to you, I suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes; right. So I tried to find out who he was talking about,
and he went with me and we couldn't find anybody that he thought he saw.
And just from the way he talked to me, I just lost confidence in what he was
trying to tell me. But I pursued it as far as I could, naturally, and asked him
if he could identify some pictures, and I got all the pictures of the men that
reported out there, and he picked out this man. And from there on, I didn't
question him any further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He did pick out the picture of W.&nbsp;J. Newman and he said that
was the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. He said he thought it was, it looked most like him. I don't
think that it was, but it looked most like him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, Newman was <span class="locked">subsequently&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. He was interviewed by Jack Revill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever talk to Newman yourself about the matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. No; I didn't engage him in any conversation about it because
I knew they were going to and I just didn't want to get him upset or say anything.
I didn't know what he wanted to exactly question him about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that you have not talked to Newman about what he might
have seen or thought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or what he reported or didn't report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. No; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you present at the time in the basement, at the time
Oswald was killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. I was not. I was at the county courthouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were not in the basement itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't know anything about what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. They were anticipating trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were in the city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I thought you meant the Dallas Police Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. No, sir; that is the county courthouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am going to mark for identification a document purporting to
be a report of an interview with you, Captain Solomon, made by FBI Agents
Hughes and Mabey on December 9, 1963, composed of two pages, and I am
identifying it by marking along the right margin line, "Dallas, Texas, March 26,
1964, Exhibit 5106, Deposition of Capt. J.&nbsp;M. Solomon," and I am signing my
name on the first page and putting on the second page my initials in the lower
right-hand corner. Captain Solomon, have you read this document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that we may recognize that we are talking about the same
thing, would you put your signature at the bottom and your initials on the
second page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. I don't think that this is what I did awhile ago. You want
my initials here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just write by the margin and initials by the second page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. [Signs and dates.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have read that document, I think, Captain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a correct report of your interview with the FBI Agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything that is omitted or that you want to change, or
modify?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Captain, do you know anything about this matter other than
what we have talked about, that you would like to put into the record, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, have you been interviewed by any member of
the Commission staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, before the commencement of this deposition,
I did not interview you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think, Captain, that I mentioned the word "pistol" a moment
ago in connection with arming of the reserves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Did you? I didn't recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You indicated to me that actually these men are not armed with
firearms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. No; they are not armed. Would you want to make part&mdash;this
part of the record? This is what I call an information sheet about what the
reserve is. A lot of times a citizen calls me and wants to know something
about it, and I mail them that.</p>

<p>(Hands to Mr. Hubert.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. I will accept this. I will mark on the front page,
Dallas, Tex., March 26, 1964, Exhibit 5107. You call that a brochure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. I call it an information sheet. We generally refer to it as a
poop sheet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am writing on this sheet, "Exhibit 5107, deposition of Capt. J.&nbsp;M.
Solomon." I am signing my name, and for identification, if you will sign yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes. That just gives a little more detail than what I told you
about it, and I had forgotten that. That might be important that they are not
armed. That is why we don't let them work in any capacity unless they are
in the company of an officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the day in question, to wit, the 24th of November 1963, the
reserve officers were in uniform but of course not armed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice that this Exhibit 5107 contains information about the
minimum standards that are required?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For admission and maintaining the status of a reserve officer, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you state that these minimum standards are in force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. One other question. Can you state that the reserve officers that
were on duty on the 24th did meet these minimum standards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have anything else to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Well, I don't suppose you want to know that we had some on
duty during the Presidential Parade? Is that important?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It might be in another aspect of the matter, but the one I am
inquiring about, it is not. However, I am sure that the information that you
have given me, generally speaking, should be made a part of the record, and
that is why I have done that. Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. You are so welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I appreciate your coming down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. All right. Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<h2 id="MWS">TESTIMONY OF M.&nbsp;W. STEVENSON</h2>

<p>The testimony of M.&nbsp;W. Stevenson was taken at 7 p.m., on March 23, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Assistant Deputy Chief M.&nbsp;W. Stevenson
of the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevenson, my name Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff
of the general counsel of the President's Commission on the Assassination of
President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963,
joint resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by
the Commission in conformance with the Executive order and the joint resolution,
I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevenson, I state to you now, that the general nature of the Commission's
inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the
assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee
Harvey Oswald, and in particular as to you, Mr. Stevenson, the nature of the
inquiry today is to determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and
any other pertinent facts that you may know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevenson, you have appeared here today by virtue of a general request
made by the general counsel of the staff of the President's Commission.</p>

<p>Under the rules adopted by the Commission, you are entitled to a 3-day
written notice prior to the taking of this deposition. But the rules provide
also that a witness may waive this notice of the taking of his deposition. Are
you willing to waive this notice in time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I am; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, will you rise and be sworn, please.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your full name, your age, your residence,
and your occupation, and how long you have been in that occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. M.&nbsp;W. Stevenson. I am 60 years of age. I reside at 3452
Boulder Drive. I am with the Dallas Police Department. Have been for 36
years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What position do you now occupy with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I am deputy chief, commanding the criminal investigation
division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hold that same position during the period November 22
to 24 of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you held that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Since November of 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Generally speaking, what are the functions of your job? What
are your duties and responsibilities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I am in command of the criminal investigation division, and
as such, I am responsible for the criminal investigation division of the Dallas
Police Department.</p>

<p>I coordinate the work among the five bureaus which constitute the criminal
investigation division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state what those bureaus are, please, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I have a homicide and robbery bureau, an automobile theft
bureau; I have a juvenile bureau; a burglary and theft bureau; and a forgery
bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you tell us now who was in charge of each of those bureaus
during the period November 22&ndash;24, of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Captain Fritz was in charge of the homicide bureau as the
immediate supervisor. Captain Jones was in charge of the forgery bureau.
Captain Nichols was off that day, and I don't know which lieutenant was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say, "that day." I was really speaking of the 3-day period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Captain Nichols, I am sorry, was in charge of the automobile
theft bureau. Capt. F.&nbsp;M. Martin was in charge of the juvenile bureau. Capt.
W.&nbsp;C. Fannin was in charge of the burglary and theft bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just to get the record clear, insofar as Captain Nichols is concerned,
you indicate he was off on 1 day of the 3-day period. Which day was that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I believe that was the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now each one of these bureau chiefs reports to you and is
responsible to you, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. That's right; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who are you responsible to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. To the assistant chief of police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Chief Charles Batchelor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the course of this examination, it would be helpful to us
if you would try to state an approximate time as to each episode or fact that
you testify to, and also indicate whether the fact or matter or episode that
you are testifying to is within your own knowledge; that is to say, gained
from your own observation, or whether the information you give us was
obtained from someone else, in that case, tell us if you can remember who gave
you the information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, would you just give us briefly an account of what you
did from about 12:30 on November 22 on forward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. At about or approximately 12:30 p.m., on the 22d, I was
at the Trade Mart on Industrial, as I had charge of the officers and the security
of the building for the luncheon of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>At about 12:30, approximately, I was notified by Secret Service Agent Grant
and Captain Souter that the President had been shot. We didn't know how
severe. It was stated that he was on the way to the hospital.</p>

<p>I immediately contacted Captain Fritz and two of his homicide men and relieved
them from their assignment at the Trade Mart and assigned them to
the investigation. As soon as I had done that, I relieved 13 other detectives and
supervisors. I believe it was 13. I told them to notify headquarters they
were available for assignment, and if no assignment, to report to the Texas
Book Depository, as it was reported that there was a possibility the suspect
might still be in the building.</p>

<p>After that, as fast as I could safely in my own opinion relieve the balance
of men who I had on duty, because it had not been announced to the entire
group there what had happened&mdash;that was at the request of the Secret Service
that we didn't want a stampede there&mdash;as fast as I could relieve the others,
I started relieving and putting them on duty and telling them to report to
headquarters or notify headquarters they were available for assignment and
any assistance they could give.</p>

<p>At approximately 1 or 1:15, I would say, Mr. Eric Jonsson notified the group
of people in the Trade Mart that the President had been shot and had succumbed.
Then as soon as we could empty the building, we relieved everyone and put
them all back on duty with instructions to report to headquarters, where we
kept them on duty as long as we needed any on any of the assignments. Chief
Batchelor was still at the Trade Mart when we finally relieved all of the men.</p>

<p>He and I left the Trade Mart and drove to Parkland Hospital to see if we
could render any assistance out there. When we got out there, we found
Mr. Lawson of the Secret Service. He stated he would be ready in a few
moments, to transfer the President's body to Love Field to be flown back to
Washington. He had no escort. He asked if we would escort the hearse
bearing the body to Love Field. We told him that we would. He, and I
believe it was a member of the White House staff, rode in the car with us.
We led the hearse to Love Field. Arrived at Love <span class="locked">Field&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what time you left the hospital, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I would say around 1:40, that is as near as I could say
offhand, Mr. Hubert. I would say 1:40 to 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you provided the escort for the hearse leaving the hospital
about 1:40?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. About 1:40 or 1:50. It's got to be somewhere in there, because
the body was not held at the hospital but a short while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Jack Ruby prior to the time that he shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, you have seen pictures of him since, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. While you were at the hospital, and I would like you to state
if you can, the time you arrived there, did you see Jack Ruby at any place
around the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, I did not. In fact, I did not get out of the car. I sat
in the car by the radio while Chief Batchelor walked into the hospital to see
if we could be of any further assistance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was about what time that you arrived there, Mr. Stevenson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I would say we arrived at the hospital around 1:40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. After we reached Love Field, the Secret Service men loaded
the casket onto the President's plane. They told us that they had called
Judge Sarah T. Hughes to administer the oath of office to President Johnson.</p>

<p>She arrived in a short time. We remained at Love Field until she administered
the oath and the plane was airborne. After the President's plane was
airborne, we left and came back to the city hall. We arrived back at the city
hall around 4 o'clock, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say city hall, do you mean police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Police Courts Building, our headquarters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For the record, I wish you would describe the relationship
between what is the police building and the municipal building of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. The Police and Courts Building is what was, until a few
years ago, the city hall proper. A new building was constructed adjacent to
this building and adjoining it just east of the Police and Courts Building.</p>

<p>It is now ordinarily referred to as the city hall, the building which is on the
corner of Main, Harwood and Commerce, which is the old city hall, now known
as the Police and Courts Building, and houses the jail, the police department,
and one or two offices of our city government. But primarily it is referred
to, or should be referred to as the Police and Courts Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, go on. So you arrived back at the police
department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. We arrived back at the office about 4 o'clock, or maybe a
few minutes later. I went directly to the homicide bureau. Chief Batchelor
went to the administrative offices.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Trade Mart, I had gotten information through Captain
Souter that the suspect in the shooting of Officer Tippit had been arrested.
On the air on the way to the hospital, we heard several squads being dispatched
to Texas Theatre. I asked the dispatcher what we had working at Texas
Theatre, and he advised me that it was the suspect who had shot Officer Tippit,
that he had been arrested at the Texas Theatre.</p>

<p>At that time I advised them that Chief Batchelor and myself, or "2" and "3,"
as I told him, which are our call numbers, were en route to Parkland Hospital
and would be in the area and back to the office as soon as possible. When I
arrived back at the city hall I went to the homicide bureau to see what progress
on our investigation was made, I was advised that Oswald had definitely been
identified in murder of Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who advised you of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Lieutenant Wells in the homicide office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Oswald at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; I didn't; he was being interviewed, but I did not
see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was interviewing him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Captain Fritz and some FBI agent, I don't know who, and I
believe a Secret Service agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you aware now of a message that had been sent by the FBI
to the Dallas Police Department concerning the security of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Not at that time, no, sir. That was Friday afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; but you didn't learn that Mr. Hoover had sent word that
great care should be taken for the security?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Not at that time, I had not; no, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you tell us without detail, generally speaking, of your
activities on the rest of the 22d, and the 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. After I was advised that he had definitely been identified
and from evidence which was being checked, it looked like he possibly might
be the same man who shot the President. I returned to my office in the administrative
offices, and was in and out of the homicide bureau on numerous times,
staying in touch with the investigation, and they were in touch with my office.</p>

<p>About 7 p.m., I believe it was 7, approximately 7, Oswald was filed on for
the murder of Officer Tippit, and was arraigned in the Police and Courts
Building by Justice of the Peace Dave Johnston, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Now at approximately, I would say, 7 or 8 o'clock, some word came to me
from Chief Curry, which apparently was from Mr. Hoover or someone from
Washington, that they wanted an agent of the FBI or Secret Service present
at all interviews. That was the first that I had heard of anything from this,
and that came to me through Chief Curry.</p>

<p>At about 12 midnight, I was advised by Lieutenant Wells, and I talked to
Mr. Alexander, assistant district attorney, and Mr. Jim Allen, former first
assistant district attorney and a friend of the department, and was advised
that sufficient evidence had been obtained and that charges were being filed
in the death of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Charges against Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Oswald; yes, sir. He was arraigned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They did not tell you at that time, did they, what evidence
it was, but simply that it was sufficient evidence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; not all of it, but they told me at that time that they
had found a rifle that they were sure was the one. They had talked to
witnesses. The officer had seen him in the Texas Book Depository a few
minutes after the shooting. He was an employee down there. He had left
the building after the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They told you all this at the time they told you that they had
enough in their opinion to charge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes; charges were filed. And at about 1:30 a.m., on the 23d,
he was arraigned in the identification bureau on the charge of murdering President
Kennedy, before Judge Dave Johnston, and was returned to his cell under
guard at that time after the arraignment. I was present at that arraignment.
I was not present at the arraignment on the Tippit case.</p>

<p>After he was arraigned, I returned to my office and was in my office, the
homicide office or bureau where I might have business for the balance of the
night up until about 3 o'clock, at which time the homicide office was closed
until the following morning. I remained on duty in the administrative offices
with detectives whom we had working that night standing by for any assignments
or any other information we might get, that we wanted to investigate
during the night&mdash;and left the city hall, the Police and Courts Building at about
12:35 Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now are you familiar with the lineup conducted in the regular
assembly or lineup room of the Dallas Police Department of Oswald when some
newspaper people were present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you tell us about that? First of all, what time was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. That was a few moments after charges were filed, I believe,
by the district attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Charges on Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. On Oswald in the President's death. The district attorney,
Mr. Wade, and the assistant, Mr. Alexander, were present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I did not go into the room, I just went to the door down there.
I was present when they did go down for the showup, but I did not go into the
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you did not look into the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I did not go into the room. The door, of course, was open,
but I was present when they left the third floor, the homicide office, to go down
for this lineup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went down to the door of the lineup room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall looking in at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes, I could look in through the open door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see a man since identified as Jack Ruby, in that room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Oh, no, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear him say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir. Frankly, I was not close enough. The only ones
that I could see or did see were those lined up in the front of the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many people were in that room, do you suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I would say, and this is an estimate on my part, Mr. Hubert&mdash;I
would say from 100 to 125, including officers and news media and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what security plan or actual operations were put
into effect with respect to Oswald during that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. When he left upstairs, he was taken back through the jail
office. From the jail office down, there is an elevator to the downstairs jail
office, onto the "showup stage," as we call it in the assembly room. He was
taken down through the jail; was not taken out from there.</p>

<p>Now to take him into the showup room, I was not where I could see how many
officers were around him. But it was necessary to bring him from the elevator
next to the homicide bureau every time we brought him down to interview him.
At that time we would have as many as three officers with him, and from four
to half a dozen officers on the route through to the next door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what check was made of the people who were
allowed into the assembly room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No one was supposed to have been in the assembly room or
on the third floor except news media properly identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was this established?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. We had officers at the elevators and the stairways with
instructions that unless they were an official or connected with an official news
media, they were not to be permitted on that floor unless they had business in
one of the other bureaus, and the officer was to escort him to that bureau.</p>

<p>We later eliminated as much of that as we could that night by calling the
jail office. If he wanted to visit some prisoner at the jail, the jail personnel
called the bureau and were instructed as to whether a pass would be permitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But do you know whether or not, as these newsmen and the rest
of the other news media went into the assembly room for this lineup, whether
they were checked in any way again upon entering?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; I don't, because when I went down to the basement,
they were already in the room. In other words, they had already filed into
the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What else do you know in general terms about the security of
Oswald when he was in the cell? I think you have already covered when he was
being moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes; there was a guard on his cell at all times, and at sometimes
there were as many as two, but around the clock a guard was placed
outside his cell door. He was not permitted to converse with other prisoners.
In fact, he was placed in a cell where it would be impossible for other prisoners
to get to him.</p>

<p>For the arraignment in the murder of the President, he was brought from
the jail into the identification bureau, where there is a barred door coming in to
identification room from jail. He was not brought back through the Police and
Courts Building proper. He was brought directly from the jail into the identification
bureau when he was arraigned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that takes us then to 12:30 on Saturday. You were on
duty until 12:30 a.m. on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you come back to duty thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I came back to the city hall Saturday evening about 7 or
7:15, and went immediately to the homicide bureau to check on any further
developments, and was advised that the case was building stronger, other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
evidence being accumulated, and if I might go back a little bit now, at around
1 o'clock, on Saturday morning&mdash;I am trying to get my time straightened out
here&mdash;the pertinent evidence that we had checked in the case of Oswald's shooting
of the President was forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory
in Washington, D.C., to be processed, the rifle and other evidence as that
for fingerprints and any other evidence that might help us in the investigation.</p>

<p>After I had gotten back to the city hall Saturday afternoon, through discussion,
I don't recall from whom, but in the hallway, that the prisoner would
not be transferred before 10 o'clock the next morning.</p>

<p>I went to Chief Batchelor and asked him about the authenticity of that
particular remark, and he said, "Yes, that's right." And I said, "Has the
press been notified?" And he said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was it that you first heard about the fact that Oswald
would not be moved Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Approximately 7:30 p.m., on the 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now just what was it you heard and what was it that was
confirmed by Batchelor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I heard, as I stated, I don't know who made the remarks,
but from the discussion in the hall, that Oswald would be moved not before 10
o'clock the next morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did the information that you received indicate a time of removal
the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Nothing but that it would not be before 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It didn't say what time after 10 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Batchelor tell you what time it would be after 10 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir. I went to Chief Batchelor&mdash;the reason I went to
Chief Batchelor with that when I heard these remarks, I wanted to know if the
press had been told. I went to Chief Batchelor and affirmed the fact that the
statement had been made and that the press had been told.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; just go ahead then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I remained at my office in the Police and Courts Building until
approximately 10:30 Saturday night, at which time I went home.</p>

<p>And returned to the Police and Courts Building at approximately 8 o'clock,
Sunday morning, the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now before you left your duty on Saturday night, do you know
of any plans that had been made for the transfer of Oswald and the security
of that transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; not on Saturday night, to my knowledge, I don't
recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then, proceed to Sunday, please, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I arrived at the basement of the Police and Courts Building
at approximately 8 o'clock. Maybe 8:15.</p>

<p>I believe Chief Batchelor arrived at about the same time, and Chief Curry
either came in near that time or a few minutes later. Now, I don't recall.</p>

<p>When Chief Batchelor and I were in the basement; we observed a Captain
Talbert had already started setting up security in the basement and on the
streets outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you describe what you mean when you say he had already
started setting up security?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. He had placed officers on the Commerce Street side of the
city hall at the top of the ramp.</p>

<p>There was two or three officers at that time, we observed, in the basement.
And I believe Captain Talbert was in the basement, and one of the sergeants,
possibly Sergeant Dean. I could be wrong on Dean being there at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was when you first came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. That was when we first arrived at the city hall. It was too
early at that time to see just where we would want the men assigned, or where
he would have them assigned, rather, because I was not assigning the men to
security other than being of any assistance to the men in my division that I
could possibly be. Chief Curry, Chief Batchelor, and myself looked over the
basement shortly after, or I would say 8:45. Chief Curry observed a large TV<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
camera sitting back in the alcove as you go into the double doors into the Police
and Courts Building of the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the basement side of those double doors, or on the jail
side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. That was just outside the jail windows after you get through
the double doors from inside the Police and Courts Building. It was sitting
outside the doors in the part of what is a part of the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. He instructed that the camera would have to be moved and
moved across the driveway into the parking area proper. He also instructed
at that time, I believe it was at that time, that the two cars that were parked,
I would say it was a squad car and a plain car, in spaces one and two, as I will
refer to them, were directly across from the door leading out of the basement,
that they would be moved and those spaces left unoccupied, no cars would be
parked in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Chief Stevenson, I have before me the chart of the basement
area including the jail office and parking area and the ramps and so forth. I
am going to date it, and I am doing so now, "Dallas, Tex., March 23, 1964, as
Exhibit 5050," in the deposition of Chief M.&nbsp;W. Stevenson. I am signing it with
my own name, and I am going to ask you to sign it just below mine, because in
your testimony from now on out, I am going to ask you to refer to this chart
and put certain positions down on it.</p>

<p>Now, when you mentioned just now, a moment ago when you said that Chief
Curry asked that two cars in spots one and two be moved off, would you indicate
on Exhibit 5050 by putting "Spot 1," and "Spot 2," what cars he was talking
about?</p>

<p>(Writing on chart.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just put "Spot," so we will know. "Spot 1," and "Spot 2."</p>

<p>All right, was that done? Were the cars moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes, sir; they were moved from those two parking spaces.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. At that time we all returned back up to the third floor. That
was approximately, I would say, 8:40 or 8:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would be you and Captain Batchelor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. That would be me and Assistant Chief Batchelor and Chief
Curry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. We went back upstairs, and I would say 30 minutes later, or
approximately 9 or 9:15, Chief Curry and Chief Batchelor had discussed the
possibility of moving the prisoner in an armored car due to some threats&mdash;incidentally,
I have to drop back a little.</p>

<p>Chief Batchelor notified me, when I met him down there that morning, that
Captain Frazier, I believe it was, had called him at home and told him that the
FBI had called up with some information that, I won't say how many, but a
group of people were going to take Oswald away from the officers on the
transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Captain Frazier tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No; he called Chief Batchelor, and he told me that Captain
Frazier had called him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Told him there had been a message received from the FBI that
someone had called the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Stating that there would be an effort made; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Captain Batchelor indicate to you at that time whether the
FBI knew who had made this call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he indicate to you that it was an anonymous call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I believe, as I remember, he did say that the message that he
got was that an anonymous caller had notified the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; go ahead with it then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. They had discussed the possibility of transferring the prisoner
in an armored car due to these threats. I walked in the office, in the chief's office
while that was being discussed, and the chief asked me what I thought about it.</p>

<p>I told him I thought it would be a good idea, in view of the threats. Chief
Batchelor went to his office to contact one of the local armored truck operators,
who was, I believe, a Mr. Fleming, and made arrangements to get an armored
truck. I remained around the office on the third floor, and I believe Chief
Batchelor and I made another trip down in the basement before I went after
some coffee.</p>

<p>Chief Batchelor advised Chief Curry he had ordered the armored truck and
told Chief Curry, he and I were going to the basement and look the area over.
We went to the basement, and Captain Talbert had set up, what we thought,
was a very good security.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see it yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes; I saw the officers, where they were distributed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state then for the record just what you saw, what
you stated you considered to be good security? And it might be that you will
want to use that chart to indicate what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. He had placed officers&mdash;he had not stationed them definitely,
but he had officers there checking everybody that came into the basement. He
had officers down there that searched the entire basement area, searching cars,
on top of the heat conduits, and so forth. He had officers on the ramp up here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wait a minute, you say, "up here"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. At the top of the Commerce Street ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many officers did he have there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I don't know just how many. He had some reserve and
regular officers. And Captain Arnett advised us, I believe it was on this trip,
that he had been instructed by Captain Talbert to move all of the people to the
southside of Commerce Street, permit none of them to congregate on the city hall
or Police and Courts Building side of Commerce, and that he had done that. We
observed that the crowd was across the street. He had an officer stationed up
here at the top of the Main Street ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know that officer's name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Vaughn, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wonder if you would write his name there in your own handwriting.</p>

<p>Let the record indicate that Mr. Stevenson is writing the name of the Officer
Vaughn on Exhibit 5050.</p>

<p>Can you tell us what officers you saw in the basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. At that time when I was down there, I cannot say other than
that I did see Captain Talbert. He was all over the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was this, about, again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. This was around 9:45, I guess. As best I recall the time on
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any of the news people there then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes, sir; there were a few. This camera had been moved.
They were back over in this area back in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, you are indicating on the chart that they had been
moved to what is called there the parking area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Parking area of the basement; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. We returned back upstairs to the third floor. Chief Lumpkin
and I went to the second floor to the patrol captain's office. Captain Talbert
came up to the office and asked us to have a cup of coffee with him, which we
did. He asked us at this time about the time of the route of the transfer. We
told him at that time that we didn't know definitely, but that we believed that
it would be east on Commerce to Central, north on Central to Main, and west
on Main to the county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say that you were not certain of that information, but that
you had gathered it? Could you expand on that and tell us where you think you
got that information? As far as you are concerned, then, there had been no
plans that you knew of as to the route?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Not the exact route at 9:45 or 10 o'clock, somewhere in that
area. He asked us what route it would travel, and we told him that we believed
that it would go up to the Central Expressway and west on Main at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you used the pronoun "we," whom do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Chief Lumpkin and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that the route, so far as you knew it at that time, would be
out of the Commerce Street exit, turning left, going beyond Pearl Street, which
was one way against the direction which you wanted to go, and then over to
North Central Expressway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Turning left again and going to Main Street, turning left again,
and then all the way down Main to Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give any instructions, or did he indicate what he was
going to do in connection with that plan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. He said that he would call 10 men from his outside patrol and
place one at each intersection on the route that would be taken to the county
jail, which, as I said, at that time we figured would be Main Street, and he did
make necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right then; go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. After we had drunk a cup of coffee, we returned back to the
third floor and were advised a few moments later&mdash;Chief Batchelor advised
me that the man had called him and that he was preparing to send the truck
now. We again went to the basement, he and I, to see about the arrival of
the armored truck.</p>

<p>I instructed Detective Captain O.&nbsp;A. Jones to go to the top of the Commerce
Street ramp leading out of the basement to notify the two officers who were on
duty there, to assist the truck when it came up and get it backed in as far as
it would go down the ramp. Captain Jones did this and advised me that he
also told Captain Talbert what he had done so that Captain Talbert would not
move the officers when they got there. The truck was en route at that time.</p>

<p>After the truck arrived and was backed in, Chief Batchelor advised me that
he and Lieutenant Smart opened the truck up and searched it completely, taking
out, I believe, a couple of empty Coca-Cola bottles or soft drink bottles.</p>

<p>I had returned to the third floor, went to the homicide office, homicide bureau
office, Chief Curry, Lieutenant Pierce, Captain Fritz, and I believe an FBI
agent, and Lee Harvey Oswald was in Captain Fritz' office and some Federal
officer had been interviewing him, oh, I would say at least for an hour, and I
was advised at that time by Chief <span class="locked">Curry&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. That was about 11:10 or 11:15&mdash;that they had changed
their plans after discussing it with Captain Fritz and that instead of using the
armored truck to transport the prisoner to the county jail, they would use the
truck as a decoy because a car would be much more maneuverable if a crowd
tried or anyone started to stop the car or take the prisoner, that the truck would
proceed east on Commerce from the Commerce Street ramp to the Central Expressway
north, north to Elm Street, Elm Street west to Houston, and would
turn left and not stop at the county jail, but pass by the county jail on Houston,
that the car carrying the prisoner followed by another car of detectives, and
Chief Curry's car, which was also parked out in the street, would leave the
truck at Main Street on North Central and turn west down Main Street and
proceed directly to the county jail.</p>

<p>And the sheriff's office had been notified and would have the steel gate open
where the car could drive in and the gate could be closed directly behind it.
When given this information, I left the homicide bureau and started back to
the basement.</p>

<p>I met Chief Lumpkin at the elevator on the way to the basement and I advised
him of the change in plan. On arriving at the basement, I advised Chief
Batchelor and Captain Jones of the change in the plan.</p>

<p>I had been in the basement a minute or two after I had advised them of the
change, and two detectives were bringing two police and plain cars from the
parking area proper onto the ramp from the parking area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
I stepped across the driveway and instructed the officers there to assist the
detective in getting these cars up on the ramp where it could back into, to pick
the prisoner up, and follow the last car which was driven by Detective Dhority.
As I came out of the parking area, the car pulled onto the ramp to back up.</p>

<p>I stepped across behind the car right over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, would you draw a little square roughly the size of the
automobile driven by Dhority, and then place a circle to indicate your own position
of that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. That is a long automobile, but as I recall, this post, I was
standing right here, and the car had gotten back to right along here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were on the south side of that post, standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I believe I was standing right here at the edge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the very front of the automobile on the right side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No; I was just about at the right door hinge. The right front
door hinge, that is where I was standing. That is a very poor drawing of
the car, Mr. Hubert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is all right. Just put in there, "police car," in that square.</p>

<p>Now you have also drawn a circle to the south of that post, and I wish you
would draw a little arrow and put your initials indicating that that was your
position.</p>

<p>Now let me get this. Did your position change from the way you have
marked it here at all up until Ruby shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; it did not. If I may explain this a little bit, from
where I have drawn this circle, this post that extends out here is built onto
the wall, and where I was standing, I could see plumb back into here. I was
not behind the post as it looks like here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much space was there between the post and the right side
of the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I would say there was 3 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, would you describe for us the position of the news media
in the basement area there, giving us as much as possible the number of people,
say, on the Main Street ramp, and the number of people in the basement area
proper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I would say from the corner of the building here, straight
across.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say, "here," just mark a point. Let's call that "number
1" to point number 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I can make that up this way, I believe.</p>

<p>I would say in this area, from here to here, and over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let's say you are talking about the southwest wall of <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. From the west wall&mdash;we term that the west side of the
driveway of the ramp to the east side, and back up to here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And back up to approximately where the ramp begins to go up,
is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Let me look at my small map.</p>

<p>I may have that marked wrong. I may not be saying what I want to say.
If I have those maps with me, I hope I have as much as I worked on that thing.
I ought to tell you with my eyes closed.</p>

<p>I evidently left them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Let's get at it this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. The driveway end out from right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Don't say from right here. Let me put it to you this way. On
the Main Street ramp, it is from <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. That would be the entrance into <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(Discussion off the record to orient positions.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From the corner which is formed by the intersection of the jail
corridor and the Main Street ramp on a line roughly due east or northeast,
rather, and another line running along the Main Street ramp, and then another
line across the ramp to the wall, how many news people were in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I would say, and it is purely a guess, from 30 to 40 on the
north ramp, Mr. Hubert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many people can you estimate could stand abreast along
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. It is 12 feet and 6 inches wide, the ramp is. I would say 5
people could stand in there side by side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It actually is a little wider, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. It is down here. That is why I was looking for another little
map I had there. It is 15 and 2 here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, roughly speaking, how many people did you see abreast
there, and how many ranks of such people were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I don't know how many ranks there were. I would say
there were, counting the officers and the detectives, and that is what I would
have to go by, because we had detectives ranging that whole area.</p>

<p>I would say they were 6 or 7 or 8 deep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And about 5 or 6 across?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that somewhere between 40 and 50 people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Possibly; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in the basement area itself, in, and particularly that portion
which faces into the jail corridor, how many people were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I would say, counting police officers and everybody, and
again that is what I'd have to go by, I would say there were at least 50 in
this area in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say this area in here, you are describing a semicircle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. From the two spaces which were cleared in the parking
area proper back <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just draw a line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. [Compliance.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you just mark within that line the number of people that
you think were within that space?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. [Compliance.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now mark the same way on the Main ramp the number of
people that were in the area on the Main ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. [Marking] Well, it is purely a guess. I would say 40 to 50,
in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me see if I can recapitulate it.</p>

<p>On the Main ramp there were between 40 and 50 newspeople standing abreast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Not news&mdash;police and all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And news people standing abreast is roughly five to six to seven
to eight, perhaps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In this other area which you have marked with a rough semicircle,
there were between 50 and 60 people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. That is an estimate, estimate on it; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you came down and observed the moving of the
vehicle driven by Dhority, were those people in the ramp and basement area
already located there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes, sir; they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what security arrangements had been made
with respect to checking the presence of those people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes, sir; the same security arrangement we had used all
the way. No one was to be permitted into the basement without being a bona
fide member of the press or news media, and to our knowledge, or to my
knowledge, there was no one down there except members of the press or police
officers, or officers from some department, a Federal officer or sheriff's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of any instructions that had been given with reference
to checking these people for identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Only what was given to them on the third floor. Now, I
don't know what instructions Captain Talbert had given the men, but he told
me he had instructed that no one would be permitted in there unless they had
a press pass and was officially connected with the news media.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you how that would be ascertained?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. By the officers checking them and checking his credentials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you had gone there earlier on the occasion of about
9:45, I believe it was, when you and Batchelor went to get coffee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. That was Chief Lumpkin and I drank the coffee, Mr. Hubert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anyhow, I am thinking about the last time that you were there
prior to your going down finally, or to put it another way, the second to the
last time you were down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. The next to the last time was after I drank the coffee,
Chief Batchelor and I went down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was it then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. About the best I recollect, around 10:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now were these news media people in those areas at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Not on the Main Street or north ramp, not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. They were back in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, back in the basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes; in the basement area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So at that time you think there were approximately, well,
twice the number of people that you have since described as were in the Main
ramp and the basement area, roughly about a hundred people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. At that time there might not have been, because that was
some 40 or 50 minutes before the prisoner was transferred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there people upstairs or elsewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Some of them were on the third floor. Some of them were
on the first floor. Now just where they all were, Mr. Hubert, prior to the
time the transfer was actually made, I don't know, but about 10:30, I would
say that there was not that many down there at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you said the first floor, you meant the first floor of the
police and courts&mdash;of the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Of the police and courts building; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have already testified concerning the relation of what
you call the courts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. The police and courts building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To the municipal building or the city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of your own knowledge whether there was any
security as to the entrance to the city hall's first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Oh, only what Captain Talbert advised me, that they did have
it sealed off and had the elevators stopped on the first floor and nothing to
come below the first floor of the city hall proper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know about what entrances do exist to the city hall
municipal building's first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>There is an entrance off of Main Street. There is an entrance off of Commerce
Street. There is also an entrance into what we call a freight elevator off
the alley on the east side which the alley runs between Commerce and Main
and right up to the east side of the city hall.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, those are the three entrances to the city hall proper other
than from the basement and the elevators up from the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn't there a corridor, however, that leads from the first floor
of the city hall to the first floor of the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what security there was with respect to that
corridor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. To my own knowledge, Mr. Hubert, I don't know other than he
did have, Captain Talbert said he had men on the first floor of the police and
courts building and I believe that you will find a steel gate that closes off the
police and courts building from the municipal building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether that gate was closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; I do not. I did not inspect that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether the entrance to the first floor of the
municipal building on Main and Commerce were locked or not locked?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I did not inspect them; no, sir. I do not know of my own
knowledge, but usually on a Sunday, those doors are locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that statement true about the door on the alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. To my knowledge, only the maintenance crews have keys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now were any policemen assigned to any of those three entrances
from the outside into the first floor of the municipal building? To wit,
Main Street entrance, Commerce Street entrance, and the service door on the
alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. To my own knowledge, I don't know whether Captain Talbert
told me that he had security on the outside of the doors of the city hall and the
municipal building, but I did not go out and check those to see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you aware then&mdash;that is to say, on November 24th, of the
position of two reserve officers called Brock and Worley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Not by name; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know that there were two reserve officers in the basement
area, one of them near the elevators and one of them near <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. This is a driveway into the parking area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The driveway into the parking area proper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. To my own knowledge, no, sir; I don't. I did not go back
to the elevators over here to check on that. My officers were in this general
area in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, you are indicating from the intersection of the
jail corridor and the ramp at the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Directly out in front of the jail office entrance, and in this
area in here, and up this way and back here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anything about the removal of those two men
from the positions indicated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you observe the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; I did not witness the shooting. If I may explain
that, when Mr. Dhority backed the car that was to carry Lee Harvey Oswald
to the county jail, then, as I have stated before, I stepped to the west side
of it and was right about the front hinge of the door. I heard someone remark
"They are coming out."</p>

<p>I looked around and observed Captain Fritz coming right through here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From the jail corridor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. From the jail corridor. When I saw him, I immediately
directed my attention to the overall basement area of our security setup to
observe anything that went on, and they had not taken but a few steps and
had not reached the back of the car when I heard a shot, and immediately
again I directed by attention to the prisoner and observed a group of officers,
I would say, some 8 or 10, subduing someone.</p>

<p>And as I stepped back here, I saw Detective Graves who had been with
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say, "stepped <span class="locked">back"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Back to where the shooting had taken place, I saw him
rise from the crowd with a gun in his hand still holding it around the cylinder.</p>

<p>Ruby was picked up and taken into the jail office, who I afterwards learned
was Ruby, and Oswald was also carried into the jail office. Lieutenant Wiggins
instructed an ambulance to be called.</p>

<p>I then stepped back out of the jail.</p>

<p>When the shooting took place, the officers on the Main Street ramp, this one
up <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would be Mr. Vaughn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I don't know that he was one that pulled his gun, but there
were several reserve officers and other officers down in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is on the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I was told by, I believe it was, Captain Jones, that the officers
up there had their guns out. And I stepped back out of the jail office after
seeing that Ruby and Oswald had been taken care of.</p>

<p>The north ramp was quiet, but the officers were having difficulty with people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the Commerce Street ramp?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. At the top of the Commerce Street ramp, or near the top.</p>

<p>I stepped back up here and told those officers that the man that did the
shooting was in custody and there was no more trouble. Ruby was taken
upstairs and the ambulance picked up Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go up with Ruby yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No; Captain King, Detective Archer, and I believe McMillon
went up with Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I mean with Ruby, pardon me. With Ruby up to the jail
office.</p>

<p>Captain King advised me when I came back down that they had stripped
Ruby of his clothing, searched him to see that he had nothing on him with
which he could harm himself or harm anyone else, and in about, oh, I would
say possibly 10 minutes after he was taken upstairs, Secret Service Agent
Forrest Sorrels did go up and talk with him, and Sergeant Dean, I believe it was,
took him up there.</p>

<p>Now this was told to me by Sergeant Dean, that Mr. Sorrels did request
to go up and talk to him, and he did take him up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe Ruby before he was stripped of his clothing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes; I observed him in the jail office after he had been picked
up, after he had shot Oswald.</p>

<p>He had been picked up from just outside the jail office door near the ramp
and was taken into the jail office, and he was standing in the jail office with the
detectives holding him, when I walked in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe any kind of press pass on his person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Ruby prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; I had never seen him before, as far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you seen him in the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Ruby say anything in your presence that you yourself heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Not that I heard myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you give any orders concerning the search of Ruby's automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you tell us what they were, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I don't recall who contacted me or called me and told me
where his car was on the parking station near the Western Union, advising me
that he had a dog in the car, a dog of some kind.</p>

<p>I contacted my Automobile Theft Bureau, which handles and is responsible
for all impounded cars, and asked Lieutenant Smart to go up and get the car.</p>

<p>He took someone with him, I don't recall who, to impound the automobile,
search it, and take everything out of it that he could find.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now you did not get your information about the location of the
car from Ruby himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you think you got it from someone whose name you don't
know or now remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I don't recall who it was. It is possible someone who had
talked to Ruby, but now I can't say about that because I just don't recall who
it was that advised me that his car was up there at the Western Union, but
I did receive the information and directed Lieutenant Smart to get the car
and search it thoroughly, impound it, and have the pound take the dog.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that when you did get the information about Ruby's car,
you also got the information that there was a dog in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who was assigned to control traffic at the corner
of Main and Pearl? That is, by the Western Union Office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or Main and Harwood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have made a statement, I think, to the FBI, have
you not, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes; I was interviewed by the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I will hand you a document that I am going to mark now for
identification as follows: Dallas, Tex., March 23, 1964, an Exhibit 5051, Deposition
of Chief M.&nbsp;W. Stevenson. I am signing my name, and I would like you
to read it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. (Reads.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Stevenson, you are signing it.</p>

<p>Do I take it by that, that that statement is correct, so far as you know?</p>

<p>At least that there are no errors in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. As far as I can see, there are no errors. Only one thing on
this, unless I missed it right here, this does not say anything of the change of
plan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. It sure doesn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, it just speaks for itself. But apparently you called to our
attention an omission from that statement which has been covered by a part
of this deposition, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. This was taken on the 25th. I guess that is right. Isn't
that the date here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; the 25th is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I don't understand why that part was omitted, but I was
interviewed, and there is nothing in here, as far as I am concerned, that is
wrong, to my knowledge, with the exception of that omission of the change in
method, of transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There may be other things also in your deposition that do not
appear in that document which we have marked as Exhibit 5051.</p>

<p>Now I show you another document which I have marked "Dallas, Tex.,
March 23, 1964, Exhibit 5052, Deposition of M.&nbsp;W. Stevenson," and I have signed
it with my own name. It is a part of the Commission Document 81-A, Page
95-A, and ask you, sir, if that is a correct statement of your interview with
Captain Sawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes, sir; it is. I might add on this one, this was to find out
about our security, the reason this one was put out, and that is the reason
they didn't go any further. You want me to sign this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes. As I understand you, that is correct, so far as it goes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you care to state for the record, Chief Stevenson, what,
in your opinion, was the cause of the breakdown of security which resulted in
the death of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Mr. Hubert, I don't know whether I can tell you the cause
or not, but there is no doubt we had a breakdown. And if our investigation is
right, it was at the Main Street ramp into the basement through which Ruby
claimed that he walked down that ramp while this officer had his back turned.
And our investigation showed that he did leave the Western Union Office some
4 or 4½ minutes prior to the shooting.</p>

<p>Our breakdown, although this is my opinion, it was unintentional on the part
of Officer Vaughn, in my opinion, he did come down that ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything else you would like to say, sir, concerning any
part of this matter whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Mr. Hubert, I don't recall a thing that I haven't attempted
to cover. However, if there is anything that I have not covered, I will be
glad to attempt to or to answer any questions that you might think pertinent to
it, and anything that I have failed to cover has been unintentional, I assure
you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I simply want to give you an opportunity now to say anything
else that you might want to say, realizing, of course, that there may be other
things which don't come to your mind at the moment, but I would like you
to think about it and tell us if there is anything at all that has not appeared
in any statement you have made or in any part of this deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. The only thing that I could say that comes to my mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
at the present is, up until Oswald was killed in the basement, we felt like
we had built a good case on Oswald as the slayer of President Kennedy, and
we felt we had done a good job on the arrest and the accumulation of the
evidence.</p>

<p>We just had a breakdown. We were let down unintentionally, in my opinion,
from the investigation, by one officer that permitted Ruby to get into the
basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you made any other statement, Mr. Stevenson, other than
those that you have identified as Exhibits 5051 and 5052?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Not to my knowledge that I recall, other than the overall
chronological report that we made to the chief of police regarding the entire
operation and plan for the visit of the President all the way through until
Oswald was slain by Ruby in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that a joint report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us who prepared that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. It was Chief Batchelor, Chief Lumpkin, myself, Chief Fisher,
Chief Lunday, Captain Souter, and all of the supervisors who had a definite
responsibility in preparing and carrying out the plans for the President's visit
to our city on November the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that a written report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have a copy of that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. It's in this. I believe I have it. (Looking.)</p>

<p>It isn't in there, sir. I believe that is the entire report.</p>

<p>(Handing papers to Mr. Hubert.)</p>

<p>I don't think it would be in there. That is our security investigation report,
Mr. Hubert. You will find that that is signed by Chief Batchelor, Chief
Lumpkin, and myself.</p>

<p>All of the officers did not sign it. We merely got their version, their reports
and things and incorporated them in one chronological report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have, Mr. Stevenson, handed me a document consisting of
34 numbered pages, the first page apparently being unnumbered, dated November
30, 1963, addressed to Mr. J.&nbsp;E. Curry, chief of police, and bearing on
page 34, the typed names of Charles Batchelor, George Lumpkin, and M.&nbsp;W.
Stevenson.</p>

<p>You have also stated to me that this copy was available to the Commission.</p>

<p>I am therefore marking it as follows:</p>

<p>"Dallas, Tex., March 23, 1964, Exhibit 5053, Deposition of M.&nbsp;W. Stevenson."
I am signing it with my name, Leon D. Hubert, Jr.</p>

<p>I am going to ask you to sign your name under mine, and I am initialling
myself, each one of the pages, and I would appreciate it, if you would also initial
each one of the pages.</p>

<p>I am placing my initials on each one of the pages in the lower right-hand
corner of each page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. (Initials each page.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Stevenson, I have now signed the first page under my signature,
that being the unnumbered page. I ask you if you have checked the
sequence of pages thereafter and find that they run in perfect sequence 1
through 34, page 34, being the last page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have also placed your initials on each one of those pages in
the lower right-hand corner below my signature, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The original of this was signed by you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. By Chief Batchelor, Chief Lumpkin, and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you delivered that to Chief Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, have you been interviewed by any of the Commission staff
prior to the taking of this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let me correct you. You were interviewed by me just before
the beginning of this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. Yes; I was. I answered too quick then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That interview took place this afternoon for about an hour and
a half, I think, immediately preceding the time that we started to take the
deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have not been interviewed by any other member of the
Commission staff except that interview with me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell me whether you perceive any inconsistency between
the deposition you have given and the interview that I conducted with you
prior to the taking of the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; I don't believe I can see any inconsistency.</p>

<p>I did do this at your request, or I say with your permission I looked over some
of my notes before the taking of this, and the only thing that I think was any
change made was in answer to Captain Talbert's question as to what the route
of transfer would be.</p>

<p>I think when I discussed it with you prior to the taking of this deposition, I
told you that we told him we thought it would go down Elm. When I reviewed
my notes, it was Main Street that we had told him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now do you know of any other material information that was
covered in the interview that preceded this deposition which has not been developed
during the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. No, sir; not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that is all unless you have anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>. I don't recall a thing else, Mr. Hubert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="CET">TESTIMONY OF CAPT. CECIL E. TALBERT</h2>

<p>The testimony of Capt. Cecil E. Talbert was taken at 7:30 p.m., on March
24, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Capt. Cecil T. Talbert, patrol division,
Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>My name is Leon D. Hubert, Jr.; I am a member of the advisory staff of the

29, 1963, joint resolution of Congress 137, and the rules of procedure adopted
by the Commission in conformance with the Executive order and the joint
resolutions, I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you, Captain
Talbert. I will state to you now that the general nature of the Commission's
inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the assassination
of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Captain Talbert, the nature of the inquiry tonight is to
to determine the facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other
pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry of the Commission.
Now, Captain Talbert, you have appeared here tonight by virtue of a general

rules also provide that a witness may waive the 3-day notice in writing. Are
you willing to waive that notice?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I'd like to waive it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, will you stand and be sworn?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I am 44.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. 1211 Toltec, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your present occupation, sir?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Police department. Captain of patrol division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been with the police department?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Seventeen years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you held the rank of captain?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. You will have to forgive me just a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, just approximately is all right.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. January 26, 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What are your duties and responsibilities on the Dallas Police
Force?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I have a patrol platoon. Three captains assigned to the
patrol division. Each has a platoon. We rotate around the clock and while on
duty would have the patrol function.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the patrol function throughout the city.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Throughout the city; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is your immediate superior?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Chief Fisher; N.&nbsp;T. Fisher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he is head of the patrol division in general?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Three captains under him?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who are the other captains?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. J.&nbsp;M. Souter relieves me, and Capt. William Frazier, who
relieves Souter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you in that same position with the same duties and responsibilities
on the 24th of November 1963?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty on the 23d of November 1963?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What hours did you serve then?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Seven to three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go off duty at 3 p.m. on the 23d?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Close to that, I mean close to that time; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the time you went off duty about 3 p.m. on the 23d of November,
had you been informed of any plans for a transfer of Oswald to the county
jail?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Not by police supervisors. I had heard the information the
chief had given the news media who had insisted on setting up their equipment
in our jail office, or adjacent to the jail office, and he insisted that they not set
it up there, and that they would be in the general public way, and only that they
could report after 10 o'clock on the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you didn't hear that from the chief himself?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Not from the chief. Only&mdash;that is hearsay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You obtained from the radio or television or newspapers?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Possibly radio and newspapers, yes, sir. You might know
we were attentive to all news media at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what time, then, did you go on duty on the 24th?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The morning of the 24th I reported when&mdash;I gave my time
of duty as 7 to 3. Actually, we report about an hour early so that we can prepare
the platoon, or any revision in the platoon that we have to make. So, at
approximately 6 o'clock, I reported to our office and relieved Captain Frazier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, at the time that you relieved Captain Frazier, did he convey
any information to you?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what he said?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Said he had a communication with Sheriff Decker and Mr.
Newsom, with the FBI, and both were anxious to transfer Oswald at the time.
Transfer him immediately to the county jail, and that he had been unable to
contact the chief due to a phone malfunction. That he couldn't call him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you what time he had received that information?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. He did; but I don't recall what time, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you of any security plans that had been made to
transfer Oswald?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you of any security plans that should be made, or had
been ordered?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he then go off duty? I am talking about Captain Frazier
now.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir; I relieved him and he went off duty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do then with reference to the transfer?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Continued his efforts to contact the chief through&mdash;going
through the telephone exchange. I wanted to contact him by telephone. He
had contacted Captain Fritz with the information from both Mr. Newsom and
the sheriff, and Captain Fritz said he couldn't transfer him until the chief authorized
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to Fritz yourself?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; that was conveyed to me by Captain Frazier before
he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. And I got the telephone company to put a buzzer on the
chief's line, and there is no response, and they have something that is louder
than a buzzer. I can't recall the term they use, but you have to get permission
from the chief operator to utilize that. I had that put on the chief's line, and
still no response. Obviously the line was defective, so, I had a squad sent to
the chief's home with the request that he call me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he call you?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From his home?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was his phone out of order?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I don't know, sir, but by all appearances, it was out of
order. I think that latter item I was speaking of was around the entire neighborhood,
almost. It is quite loud, even though a phone may be off the hook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you say to the chief?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I repeated the conversation that Frazier had told me that
the sheriff had told him, and also Mr. Newsom had told him about two calls
received by the FBI office during the night. Both by men speaking in a calm
voice and both conveyed the same message that before Oswald reached the county
jail "A hundred of us will see that he is dead." And the request by Sheriff
Decker, and Mr. Newsom, that he be transferred immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was your understanding that Newsom had received a message
twice?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. His office. Not Mr. Newsom personally. His office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. Do you know whether any such message had also been
received by the sheriff's office independently?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you convey that information?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. It was approximately 6:30, my conversation with Chief
Curry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give you any instructions?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. He said if I would call the sheriff and Mr. Newsom, tell
them that he would be in his office between 8 and 9, and he would contact them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. After that, what did you occupy yourself with?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The usual duty of getting my platoon on duty and balancing
the detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do anything looking toward the ultimate transfer of
Oswald?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Not at that time; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you begin to do anything with reference to the
transfer?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Approximately 9 a.m. Traffic was building up rather heavy
on the downtown streets. Primarily on Commerce, people going by the intersection
of Commerce and Houston and the&mdash;viewing the Book Depository Building,
and we had a few people gathering on Commerce Street side of the city
hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see them gathering on the Main Street side?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know why?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Evidently the people who were gathering realized that our
exit side was Commerce and our entrance side was Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a fact?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. That is a fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say internally, your traffic goes from Main to Commerce,
and goes no other way?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is a one-way ramp?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir; all of our vehicles enter on Main Street and exit
on Commerce Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, there is no physical reason why it couldn't be the
opposite?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir; there is. Commerce is one way, and makes it more
difficult to&mdash;Oh, I'm sorry. There is no physical reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No. That's all right. You have explained it. You had misunderstood
what I meant when I said, "physical."</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Actually, it is an internal rule, that is, a normal rule because of
the fact that Commerce is a one-way street.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The accessibility to the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Main is a two-way street?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did Chief Curry come in?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I don't know, sir. I didn't see him all day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't see him all day on the 24th?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir. I mean I don't recall having seen him. I didn't
converse with him. If I saw him I didn't converse with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you take any action about looking to the movement or transfer
and the security thereof, of Oswald?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. That is a very broad statement and can we narrow it down
into my actions taken of any probable disturbance that we might have around
the city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just tell us what you did.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. All right, sir. At 9, or about, Lieutenant Pierce, that is
Sam Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Rio Pierce?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Sam.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sam Pierce?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Rio Sam Pierce. R.&nbsp;S. Pierce. [spelling] R-i-o, just like
the river. Rio Sam Pierce is my central area lieutenant, and I talked the
situation over with him about the traffic problem, and the people that were
giving the appearance of going to start gathering on the Commerce Street side,
and what we should do about the possible security around the city hall. It
would have to alleviate having to call the squads in over the dispatcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
At the time, we were working on a Sunday detail, which is one of our
smallest. Sunday is a less active day, and we have fewer people working on
Sunday, that is, than we do any other. That is the day we try to get most of
our&mdash;not "most," I'm sorry, that is a poor term. We cut our detail down on
Sunday due to the fact that police activity is light. So, I talked it over with
him about what we should do about the method of security of the area, and finally
decided that if&mdash;for him to pull three squads from each of the three substations,
and four squads out of the central station, and to pick two-men squads
where possible so that we could build up the total number of men that we had
as quick as possible.</p>

<p>This second platoon, the day platoon, works primarily one-man squads,
and our two-man squads are trainee squads. The trainees work with an older
officer and create a two-man squad there. Could you leave this off just a
moment? That is <span class="locked">something&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; then, you decided to set up some system of security
for the police department building?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I further told Lieutenant Pierce to have the basement
cleared of all personnel. Have them searched. Thorough search, and secure
it, letting only the authorized news media and police officers into the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">What&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The basement area <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What system of authorizing newsmen was in use?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Using their press identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had that been issued specially?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. That is the general order, 81, I believe that is the number
of it. I don't know whether you want to include that in here or not. I
believe general order 81, is that we would utilize&mdash;this is a long-standing&mdash;that
we will utilize the normal press identification to permit news media into scenes
of incident areas. The amateurs, bystanders, were kept out because they don't
have those <span class="locked">identification&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that an identification commonly known to police personnel?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. They scrutinize it. No, sir; each could utilize these different
types, but you have to scrutinize their identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you say that you permit these persons to enter, but civilians
without news identification could not enter?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was in effect that day?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I utilized it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I mean, the order was in effect?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. It had not been revoked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you utilized it?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, it was determined that when you were clearing out
the basement, you would clear out all persons who were not police officers or
news media properly identified?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, can you tell me why you did that as to the basement?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The basement&mdash;I am using a very loose term in "basement,"
I meant, and did convey to Lieutenant Pierce, "the area," in which Oswald
would be&mdash;if he was transferred, and I used that term, "if he was transferred,"
I didn't know that he would be. Although, our basement was becoming cluttered
with newsmen at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been told by anyone that Oswald would be removed
from the upper story of the building by use of the jail elevators to the jail
office, and from the jail office through the jail corridor into the basement ramps.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. At that time; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">But&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. But, of my own knowledge that is the only way he could
be removed to a car unless he went through another floor and out on the
street. That is the way you go in the normal police building area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And do you mean that the normal method for handling would be
one where he would be brought to the elevator to the jail office, and into the
basement?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, would you state just what you did by way of clearing the
basement area?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Lieutenant Pierce gave the assignment to Sergeant Dean,
and in turn to Sergeant Putnam to carry out, and in various stages of the searching
of the basement I think he checked it himself, at approximately 10 o'clock,
and I gave, by the way, the initial instructions to bring those squads in. I told
them to disperse their cars, park them on the street, but disperse them. Not
have them grouped up, and to report to my office by at least 9:30, and he did
have that accomplished, and he gave the instructions to clear the area and
search it to Sergeant Dean, who got Sergeant Putnam to assist him in it.
About 10 o'clock, I went down to check and see how he had progressed at that
time. They had checked the news media, they were set up in the jail office.
The jail office proper. They had cameramen, cameras, reporters on top of the
booking desk, on top of everything available. The news media was taking over
the jail office rather heavily, and insisted the chief had given them permission to
do so. That was about 10. I went into the basement area and Sergeant Putnam
gave me a lengthy rundown, step by step, on what he had done, or had done&mdash;see
what I mean about my English?&mdash;and had accomplished in clearing that
area, and I personally checked all the doors to the several rooms that led from
the parking area to see that they were locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you specify for the record what doors you did check?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Starting in around on the side of the ramp, janitor's room.
Could you hold it a minute and let me see if I can identify it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, I think we'll get on the record.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Shall we just say "checked the painters' room"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I want to get more particular points than that. Now, since
you are about to describe your activities with reference to a definite area, I
want to show you a map or chart of the basement and jail office area, and in
order that we may properly use it in connection with your testimony, it is
necessary for me to identify it. Therefore, I am marking it, "Dallas, Texas,
March the 24th, 1964. Exhibit 5070, deposition of Capt. C.&nbsp;E. Talbert." And I
am signing my name to it, and for the purposes of identification, I'll ask you
to sign your name just below mine. Now, you say that you, yourself made a
personal check of what is shown on this Exhibit 5070, as the parking area?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wait. Where did you begin? Right in here?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Right about here, to here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am marking with a numeral, "1" in a circle, a point
that you have indicated to me as the starting point of your inspection tour, and
exactly just what did you do there?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Well, that's&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then I am going to ask you to just simply draw a line as
to the general portion that you want, and whenever you stopped, we will mark
the stop with No. "2, 3 and so forth", and just use this map and mark it in that
way, keeping in mind that you must speak in such a way that a person who
reads this later on may be able to understand the movements. Now, you are
starting at a point that is marked No. "1" in a circle?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I checked the door No. "1", which is the painters' room to
see that it was properly locked. I proceeded to the doctor's room, and I checked
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you are marking <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. That is "2."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. "2" in a circle?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I asked what has been done about the doctor's services.
Sergeant Putnam told me he had moved that doctor out of that room and into
the police locker room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you check those doors?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Checked the door to see that it was locked, and it was; yes,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was locked from the outside? Could somebody in there have
come in?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. There should have been no one in there, because there is
no entrance to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you check in the doctor's room?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; I had no key to get in. The doctor and the porter
would have the key, but I didn't have. I went to this [indicating]. This is
the stairway, and this&mdash;there is another&mdash;there is another stairway coming in
here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From point "2"?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Actually, this is&mdash;can you stop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I went to point "3" and tried the other door which was
locked externally. Went to point <span class="locked">"4"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before you leave point "3," did you know whether that door was
locked from the other side?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that a person in the <span class="locked">stairwell&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. That is not the stairwell, sir, that is the second door of
the first aid station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, the second door of the first aid station?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. "3" it is the second door of the first aid station. "4" to
the stairwell leading downstairs to a subbasement, engineroom, and leading
from the first floor down to the basement area is a fire escape type&mdash;that door
was secured from the outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if anybody on the inside of that door could have
come from the stairwell into the basement?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir; it has&mdash;that particular door, I have since learned&mdash;I
didn't know it at that time, but I have since learned that that particular door
has a fire escape type latch. That bar-type latch, and I did check and find that
the first floor&mdash;not the basement, but the first floor of the city hall had its
interior door, both on the Commerce Street, Main Street, and the hallway locked.
It is a procedure that they use over the weekend, and after 6 p.m., in the
afternoon, those doors are locked, so, anyone not in the building at the time
wouldn't have had access to this unless someone unlocked it for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you check those entrances at the first floor of the municipal
building on the 24th?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you do that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. As I recall, just from the&mdash;this particular time after finishing
this search, I went to the sidewalk area on Commerce, and into the entrance
that is left open for payment of water bills and the interior door there was
secure and locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, then a person could not get into the first floor of the city hall
through that door on Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir; and in further checking around the building I
went through the police courts building and in checking the Main Street door
and then, in turn, checked the Main Street entrance, and it was locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Main Street entrance to the municipal building?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. To the municipal building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was locked?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. And it was locked; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you check the several entrances on the alleyway which
runs from Main to about halfway up the block and makes an L-turn and then
runs to Pearl?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I did not check that entrance, because the thing is locked
any time after 6, and on the weekends. We can't enter that way. Matter of
fact, we have orders not to enter that way at anytime, but sometimes we, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
parking, we find it convenient to enter through that elevator and the service
elevator from that entrance, and we always find it locked. We have to get a
porter's attention by banging on the door to get it unlocked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Since we are on that subject, how would you go through that
service entrance on the alleyway into the first floor of the municipal building?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The service entrance has some side doors leading off of it.
I don't know whether they are broom closets, or go into rooms or what, but
into the service elevator, both sides of the elevator has operable doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is&mdash;so call it the Harwood side on the elevator, and the
Pearl Street side.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. This is going to the Central Expressway over here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. And, so, the&mdash;the expressway side and the Harwood Street
side has doors that do open. Both sides of that elevator have doors that would
open, and the operator could open either one of them, and you can come in from
the entrance and exit from this Harwood Street side. Enter from the expressway
side and exit from the Harwood Street side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If it were possible for a person to gain entrance through the
service entrance into the first floor of the municipal building by use of the
service elevator, that is to say, by walking through both of the doors of the
elevator, he could then get into the stairwell of the fire escape on the first floor,
could he not?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And by walking down to the basement level at the <span class="locked">point&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Designated "4"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Designated "4," he could get into the basement area in that way.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir; but we had an operator on the service elevator with
instructions not to allow anyone to basement, and he was&mdash;allowed no one to
come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who that person was?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I believe his name is Mitchell, sir, to the best of my memory,
is his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is he a member of the police department?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; he is a porter, a colored porter who works within
the city hall building, itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to that man?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you tell him?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. At the time, I told him to take his elevator up on the first
floor. I put the parking attendant on that elevator, or instructed the parking
attendant to get on that elevator and go up to the first floor, and for the parking
attendant to maintain a vigil lookout on this elevator marked Nos. "1" and "2"
here, which will be "5" and "6" in my route. I told him to see that no one came
nearby those elevators, and told the operator of the service elevator to stay on
it, and not bring anyone to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was the parking attendant?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I'm going to have to utilize his nickname, and it is rather
far-afield. I should know his name. His nickname is "King," it is one we
have used for quite some time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is he a member of the police department?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; he is a colored parking attendant who works for
the municipal garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether he carried out your orders, Captain Talbert?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. To my knowledge, he did. I don't know that he did, but
to my knowledge, he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't know to the contrary then?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, will you continue, then, your security search which we had
left off, I think, at a point marked "4"?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I went from point "4," the elevator&mdash;the stairwell, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
elevator. The first service elevator to the building on the&mdash;not service elevator,
delete that, young lady&mdash;first elevator in the building marked "1", here, but
will be marked "5" in this route. And that door was closed. Went to the next
elevator which was immediately adjacent to the first one marked "6," that
door was closed, indicating the elevator was not on that floor. These are
automatic elevators and the doors would be open if it was. Then went to the
service elevator, and had the foregoing conversation with the operator and the
parking attendant. That is marked No. "7."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, just continue your search?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. From that area, or in that immediate area I had another
discussion with Sergeant Putnam and asked him about the engineroom elevator,
this elevator being on the extreme corner of the parking area on Commerce
Street, next to the ramp. This elevator comes from the engineroom to the
parking area only, and doesn't go to the first floor. Anyone entering through
that elevator would have to be in the engineroom, which is a subbasement, to
enter into this basement. That is the only place it goes. One floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have marked that how?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Marked that "8." Sergeant Putnam had placed a reserve
officer at that point <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, were any other reserve officers placed in the
parking area, to your knowledge, or any other officers for that matter?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. May I mark <span class="locked">on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Surely.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. A reserve officer whose name I do not recall, was placed
at a point marked "9," with the instructions not to permit anyone to enter the
parking area from the elevators or stairwell. But a reserve officer was placed
in the point marked "8." We&mdash;I think we have that in the deposition now.
Reserve officers were, at that time, brought forward when I asked if the conduits
had been searched, the top of the conduits, and&mdash;the air-conditioning
conduits, if they had been searched. They brought the two reserve officers forward
who had the filthiest uniforms. It was quite obvious that they had been
crawling around on top of them. They had searched them, and I took their condition
to state that their search had been thorough and the fact that Sergeants Putnam
and Dean told me that they had covered each one, that the engines, engine
compartments, the trucks as well as the vehicles parked in the basement had been
searched for possible hiding places, and all of this was accomplished. After
the search was accomplished, after officers were placed in the adjacent ramps
on the Commerce Street side, on the Main Street side, and from the lobby of
the police building marked "10," lobby of the police building into the area in
front of the jail office leading into the ramp area&mdash;may I mark the places
where the officers were now? The reserve officers&mdash;we are getting a&mdash;can I
hold it for a minute?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. All right, now, I will go ahead and mark the area where
we had <span class="locked">each&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; you marked "10," that you had an officer there.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I had an officer and&mdash;a reserve officer was at "11." Two
detectives were&mdash;Lowery and Beaty&mdash;Beaty and Lowery. "12" and "13" most
of this period. Number "14" on the Main Street entrance to the police ramp
was Vaughn, R.&nbsp;E. Vaughn, and number "15" and "16" were Patrolman Jez
and Patrolman Patterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you ever order the reserve officer at the point "9"
removed?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know that he had been?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; at 11 o'clock, when the detail was made up to put
traffic men on Elm Street, it was gathered in that area, and that man was in
place at that time, at 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. If he was moved after 11 I don't know who moved him or
where he went, but the reserve officer "9" was in place at that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't know what his name was?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I believe Brock is going to be his name, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think it is Brock. Now, then, you mentioned something about
drawing off persons to patrol the intersection of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you tell us something about that, please?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. We had kept as many officers out of the basement area as
possible to keep from adding to the confusion of the search so we could make
a systematic search, and I had retained all of the excess officers, and, as I
recall, numbered about 13 regular police officers in my office and the reserve
officers, and excesses were retained in an assembly room which would be behind
the jail office, and after about 11&mdash;let's back up and make that about 10:45&mdash;in
that vicinity, Chief Stevenson and Chief Lumpkin contacted me about the
route of the proposed transfer of Lee Harvey Oswald, and they asked&mdash;correction&mdash;I
asked if we were going to use marked cars or plain cars, or if we were
going to utilize sirens to stop traffic at intersections?</p>

<p>Chief Stevenson said he didn't want any attention attracted to the transfer
that wasn't already attracted to it, and asked if I had enough personnel to put
in the intersection of Elm Street. First he said Main Street. The first route
planned was Main, and it was changed to Elm before I could so disperse the
personnel, so, actually, we utilized Elm all through this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just as it was?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. And they said first Main and then before&mdash;after I had
removed the men from my office to the ramp&mdash;not the ramp area, but the parking
area and told Sergeant Dean and Sergeant Steele to place them on each
intersection to stop traffic for the lights as the people making the transfer
approached them. Found then that it was to be Elm Street instead of Main,
that it was to be Elm rather than Main and the traffic could go&mdash;the reason
being that they could swing off of Elm into Houston, directly into the prisoner
loading area of the sheriff's office, and those 13 men were placed by Sergeant
Steele at each intersection. He didn't have enough. I instructed him that he
obtain any additional men he might need from the captain who was in the area
of the county jail, and he later called me by phone and told me of the traffic
conditions down there, and I had an estimate, I don't recall whether from him
or some other officer of the approximate number of people in that area, said
around 600 or so gathered up around the county jail; so I instructed Steele to
have each one of the men fall in behind or follow fairly closely behind the
conveying vehicle so they would be available for any trouble that might
develop around the county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you ever told by anyone of the plans of the transfer?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is, the ultimate plan or <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any sequence of plans?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. After the plans had been instituted, Lieutenant Pierce,
who I had sent to the homicide bureau previously to see if we could be of any
assistance, or see if he could do anything&mdash;I didn't see him enter the basement,
but as he pulled up onto the ramp&mdash;or in an effort to enter the ramp, he stopped
his vehicle and called me over and asked me to get in his car. I opened the
door, got in on the right-hand side of his car and he told me my&mdash;I omitted
something, I believe, about this armored car, haven't I? Do you want that
in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We'll come back to it.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. All right. He told me that he had been instructed to take
a car out and get in front of the armored car which was backed into the ramp
on the Commerce Street side and to lead the armored car. He was to be the
lead vehicle and the armored car, it would go up northbound on Central to
Elm, west on Elm and swing in off of Elm on to Houston Street. That two
plain cars would pull up behind of the armored car. The prisoner would
actually be in the last plain car, and the first plain car would be full of armed
homicide officers, and it would cut off on Main Street, west. It would leave
the city hall with the cavalcade, and when it hit Main Street the two plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
cars with the homicide officers in them with the prisoner would make a left
and go west and the armored car and the lead vehicle there would continue to
Elm and then west. The two vehicles, or rather the two groups of vehicles
would be paralleling each other. One on Main, and one on Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what the plans were with reference to the controlling
of traffic on Main Street on which the prisoner was actually going to
be transferred?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; that was the first information I had is the fact
that the prisoner would not be in the armored car. Up until that point, I
assumed he would be in the armored car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, at that point, it became apparent that he was not going
to be in the armored car?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had already set up a traffic-control system by having assigned
men at various intervals on Elm?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Elm; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, if they were going to use Main Street, what control would
be used for cross traffic, crossing Main Street?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I have no knowledge, sir. Probably normal transportation,
more than likely. That is strictly my idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you said that you wanted to say something about the
armored car.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir; I had previously been instructed about the armored
car by Chief Stevenson and Chief Lumpkin, that was at the time they
asked that the officers be placed on Main, and later transferred in to Elm
Street, and at the instruction I had, was to have a man be observant, to make
sure that the armored car didn't hit&mdash;didn't jam it into the overhead of the
rampworks.</p>

<p>When the armored car arrived they did back it into the Commerce Street
side, and the driver left it up near the front of the ramp because of its weight,
rather than height. Although, due to its height, it couldn't have backed much
farther down the ramp, but he was afraid that due to the weight of the car the&mdash;it
wouldn't pull it out. The engine wouldn't have enough power to pull it out of
the ramp, and so it was left in that position until after Lieutenant Pierce pulled
the plain car that was his normal assignment car, I think equipment 239, although,
that is irrelevant, attempted to pull it up the ramp. He couldn't get
through the news media, which I would like to add to a little later. I previously
had the news media in the jail office. Now, during one of my inspection trips
I inspected the first floor of the Police and Courts Building from the doors for
Harwood and Main Street to see that there was no congestion, and also, to look
the crowds over on Commerce, and during one of my trips, or perhaps I was contacting
the dispatcher&mdash;I was still conducting my regular patrol duties&mdash;the news
media was moving from the jail office to the ramps to clear the jail office of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you supervise that movement?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; Chief Batchelor arrived and was told of the preparation
that had been made in the basement, and I assumed looked at the office.
I wasn't present, but I assume he looked in the office and asked that that news
media be removed. He was talking to Sergeant Putnam and Sergeant Dean.
I wasn't present, nor was Lieutenant Pierce there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, the news media were moved out of the jail area and where
did they then go?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I was told&mdash;and this by Sergeant Putnam&mdash;that they were
first placed on each side of the ramp leading from Main and Commerce, and after
the chief observed the conflict there, he had those on the Harwood Street side
of the ramp moved across the ramp onto the Main Street side to keep&mdash;to make
more room for vehicular traffic, and that, of course, was from Sergeant Putnam
to me. I don't know what <span class="locked">instigated&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did you have occasion to observe the news media in the
ramp and parking areas just prior to the shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, I think I should like to have you describe that, and in
order to facilitate that, I am going to draw a general oblong figure which I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
marking "Area A," and I'm going to draw another general oblong figure which
I am marking "Area B," and I would like you to tell us for the <span class="locked">record&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. May I inject <span class="locked">another&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, then, I will mark another oblong area, which I will call
Area C.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like you to describe that for the record&mdash;that is, what
were the conditions of those areas particularly with reference to congestion
of people?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Across from "Area A," there was complete double line and
in some instances triple line of men. That was men with cameras and those
without. Just the reporters who had no cameras, and in "Area B," in the
center of "Area B" <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before you leave "Area A," would you say that the men were
shoulder to shoulder?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Oh, more than that. Crammed in there. <span class="locked">Jammed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Touching each other?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And about three ranks back toward Main Street?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. That is my impression, yes, sir, about three ranks back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Describe "Area B," then?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. And "Area B," you had a railing as indicated here by a
dotted line. In front of that railing you had at least two or&mdash;probably three
ranks of people all the way down to the turnoff area, which is the beginning
of "Area C." In the center of "Area D," there were two fixed cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Television cameras?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Television cameras, yes, sir. The others were movie or
still cameras and other cameramen, or strictly reporters, and in "Area C," we
had a fairly dense group in the immediate Main Street side, and two to three
ranks over towards the Commerce Street side dividing it in half.</p>

<p>Now, immediately after Lieutenant Pierce informed me of the change in plans,
we had to remove the people from the ramps so that he could get out on the
Main Street side, and they immediately closed back up, and as he cleared the
parking area to enter the ramp, a plain white or light-colored car pulled onto it,
and pulled up behind the armored car on the Commerce Street side, and another
plain light-colored car attempted to pull up behind him, but he wasn't up far
enough, so, we had to holler at them to pull up a little further, which he did.
That car was attempting to back in, and had to cut to the left in order to back
up the vehicle&mdash;go to the right to get back into the jail-office entrance. That
was my understanding of his efforts to do, and the news media was crowding
in on him, so, that there was danger of him running over them with his vehicle,
should it move. So, I was by the left front fender of that vehicle, Chief Batchelor
was to my right, Captain O.&nbsp;A. Jones to my left and we were&mdash;and one or two&mdash;perhaps
more reserve officers were there, too, pushing the news media back to
let that car have room to maneuver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am going to mark on the map an area which I am marking
auto <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With the understanding that the front of it indicated by an arrow
is pointed toward Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, would you mark the circle where you were
about the time of the event you have just described?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. This auto is angled in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Maybe we had better angle it then.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Would you like that black pen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You do it. We, are changing the blue-pen marking because
Captain Talbert indicates that the automobile was on an angle, and he is now
marking it with the black pen. Would you put the word "auto," in that, please.
Now, draw a circle and indicate where you were standing.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I was standing by the left front fender of the car, as I
previously said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. [Drawing a circle and indicating it number "7."]</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Compared with the other, yes. And Chief Batchelor was
standing just to the left front of the vehicle, and&mdash;I can't draw it in there
with this circle correctly, but&mdash;we'll indicate that "18," Capt. O.&nbsp;A. Jones was
standing to my left, or to the rear of the vehicle from me. Indicating that to
be "19," and at the time that vehicle was attempting to back up, we had pushed
them back far enough for it to maneuver. At the time it was attempting to
back up, there was a muffled report, a muffled shot and bedlam broke out in the
vicinity of the jail office entry into the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see the shot?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; I heard it, but did not see the shot and that there
was my first knowledge that the prisoner was in the ramp area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which way were you facing just before the shot?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Just before the shot, I was facing the crowd. I had faced,
alternately, the automobile and the crowd, as we were attempting to get the
thing back, and I was facing the crowd and could feel the automobile pushing
against me, I was turning around and pushing back against the car, and as I
made a little room, faced the crowd again and pushed them back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Lieutenant Pierce's car leave?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; I didn't see Lieutenant Pierce's car leave, because
of the news media across "Area A." They screened it from me and also because
of my preoccupation of getting these two plain cars up behind the armored
vehicle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Ruby?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I know his face. I know his name. I know his reputation
well. I don't know him personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever met him before?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him that day?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean after the shot?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. After the shot, yes, sir. I'm sorry. After the shot, or after
this muffled report, I went over the back of the trunk of this automobile we
were trying to back in. Because of these people pushing in I couldn't get&mdash;so,
I went over the back trunk of it to get to the officers. I saw they were down,
and the melee that was taking place, as news media was crowding around in on
them, and I give them a little room, and saw both Oswald and another man there
who was being dragged into the jail office by the other officer. As soon as we
got some room for them to drag them in, I shouted to the top of the entrance
both on Commerce and on Main&mdash;this may not give you the perspective scope
correctly, but it is about 90 feet on&mdash;from the place of the shooting to the Main
Street entrance. I shouted up to the entrance, "let nobody out," or "nobody out,"
or something to that effect, and shouted to the top past the armored car the
same thing. "Nobody out," and officers on this door told them, "Nobody out,"
and then went into the jail office, and Ruby was lying on the jail office floor
where&mdash;with the officers at the time, attempting to handcuff him, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize him at that point?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I saw his face. That I recognized, but I didn't recognize
him as "Ruby." I asked a question, and may I say this in front of the young
lady? I have to apologize. Do you want it verbatim?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes. I'm afraid so.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I asked the question&mdash;I said, "Who is this son-of-a-bitch?"
And he was saying, "I'm Jack Ruby. Everybody knows me. I'm Jack Ruby."
At the same time another officer, or perhaps to answer that&mdash;"That's Jack Ruby,
he operates the Carousel Club."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was when you first recognized him?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As being someone that you knew?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had not seen him prior to that time on that, day, to your
knowledge?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir, nor for 2 years prior to that, to my knowledge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Approximately 2 years prior to that I was having breakfast at the Pancake
House at the Ramada Inn with other officers when a man going out&mdash;we were
sitting down and the man was going out and passed by and stopped. Was&mdash;and
he was obtrusively friendly with the other officer, one of them he knew.
He knew Lieutenant Pierce who was with me, and Lieutenant Pierce introduced
me to him, and from that point until the point where he was on the floor
at the jail office, I don't recall having seen him, and the only reason that I
remember the Pancake incident, it was after the incident I was reminded of
the incident by Lieutenant Pierce. I don't recall of having met him at any
time since the old days of his operation at the Silver Spur.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to him, or see him after that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir, I asked&mdash;at that time. I didn't know they had the
gun. I didn't see the gun, so, I thought it was still in the crowd, and I asked
Chief Batchelor for permission to put all of the news media in the police assembly
room for interrogation, or somebody said, "I don't think we have the
gun." One of the officers who was kneeling on Ruby&mdash;literally, you couldn't
hardly see Ruby for this officer kneeling on him&mdash;said, "I have the gun." Or
perhaps he said, "Graves has the gun." And then I told Chief Batchelor that
it wouldn't be necessary to search them.</p>

<p>I got a batch of memo pads from the jail office and gave some of them to
Sergeant Everett, passed some out myself, told the officers to get the names,
identification and location at the time of the shooting of anyone before they
let them out of the basement. Chief Batchelor had told me to go to Parkland
and secure it. I immediately got in my car, got on there and told the dispatcher
to gather up all of my squads and to have them to report to me code 3, at
Parkland and followed the ambulance out to Parkland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first hear that Ruby had stated that he had come
down the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I started my own investigation. Of course, I had nothing
to do with this official investigation of the incident in the basement, but it is
only natural that a police officer and a police supervisor is going to instigate
his own investigation. I started mine from the hospital on the phone, and
that question would be impossible to answer. I may have heard it through the
news media. I heard&mdash;may have heard it through another officer who had
overheard what they said up in the jail. It could have been something of
that sort. I couldn't tell you exactly, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you, in fact, conduct an independent investigation of your
own?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Just a very cursory one, and during a very brief period until
the official investigation got underway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long a time would that have been?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Well, <span class="locked">maybe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Put it this way, what did you do by way of instigating the
investigation?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Contacted, attempted to ascertain how Ruby entered the
ramp, or entered the parking area rather. I contacted each of my officers
who were on the entrances, and I did that while I was at the hospital. That
was before the death of&mdash;or during the operation on Oswald, and while we
still had the hospital secured by the squads, and I contacted the supervisors
who were there, and after that I was told that an official investigation would
be conducted, and I dropped it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say that it was about an hour?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; I wouldn't estimate the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you contact Vaughn particularly?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir; I had contacted Vaughn. Then contacted him the
next day. I found that Vaughn had let one man in onto the ramp that he
hadn't included in his report the next day. This man being a city employee, a&mdash;one
who Vaughn thought was authorized to enter the ramp. He was Chenault,
the mechanic in charge of the garage, so Chenault told Vaughn. This was
not in Vaughn's report, but when Vaughn was broached with it, and this was
on the 26th&mdash;I believe that could have been the 27th. Could you hold <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Let me just say that when Vaughn was broached with
having described this one entry into the ramp, that was the day after his
report had been written, and I had had a chance to review all the reports,
I obtained a copy of all the officers' reports and let them stand even though
some of them were conflicting and deleting things&mdash;now, these were not the
officers on the door, but the officers on the street. That some of them conflicted
about who told them to do what. But I didn't have them change them
as I normally would, because of the incident, and also because of the nature
of the incident, and also because of my involvement in this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn't it a fact that Vaughn had filed a report in which he failed
to report that he had let Chenault go down the ramp?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir; Vaughn, in his report, did not note anything
about anyone coming in the ramp other than squad cars and the paddy wagon.
No pedestrian traffic denoted, but when I went over it with him in the presence
of Chief Fisher and Sergeant Putnam, he recalled&mdash;Vaughn without our having
to bring it to his attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He recalled Chenault?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I'm sorry. He recalled Chenault without our having to
bring it to his attention and inserted it in his verbal report, and that was
after the written report, which was an oversight on his part. Chenault, may
I add, was immediately evicted from the basement by Sergeant Putnam when
he saw him come down the ramp. He had him leave. Chenault said that
he needed to check the vehicles in the basement and to see if any of them needed
to be in the garage, and Sergeant Putnam told him that he could do that later;
to leave the ramp area at that time, and he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mentioned the paddy wagon coming down the Main Street
ramp.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. It is a fact that the paddy wagon did come in. However,
each vehicle coming in was searched, and the paddy wagon was operated by
an officer named Lewis. The front seat of the paddy wagon was searched
and the back of the paddy wagon was <span class="locked">searched&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Chief Fisher&mdash;before they let them into the ramp. By
Sergeant Putnam, himself, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't know of any record of how many paddy wagons or
other vehicles came down Main Street ramp after Vaughn was posted and until
the shooting?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I recall three in the reports. I didn't see any of it&mdash;of
them, but I recall three in the reports. One being a paddy wagon. One
vehicle contained two detectives. Another vehicle operated by R.&nbsp;A. Watts,
with a juvenile prisoner. Watts was not permitted to leave the station and
the prisoner was booked, and he was retained to assist in the security.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Captain Talbert, I am going to mark for identification
an FBI report of an interview which you made on November 24, 1963, Dallas,
Tex., March 24, 1964, as Exhibit 5065, deposition of C.&nbsp;E. Talbert, and I have
signed my name to it. It is a one page document. I am marking another
document consisting of two pages. Placing upon it, "Dallas, Tex., March 24,
1964, Exhibit 5066, deposition of C.&nbsp;E. Talbert." I am signing my own name
below that, all of which is on the first page of the document which is the FBI
report by Special Agent Vincent Drain, dated November 25, 1963. It consists
of two pages and I am placing my initial on the bottom right-hand corner on
the second page. I also am marking for identification another document,
being a copy of a letter apparently addressed by you, Capt. Cecil Talbert to
Chief Curry, dated November 26, containing five pages. The first page I am
marking as follows: "Dallas, Tex., March 24, 1964, Exhibit 5067, deposition
of Capt. C.&nbsp;E. Talbert." And I am signing my name below that now, and I
am placing my initials in the lower right-hand corner of each of the following
pages. I am marking on a single page document purporting to be an FBI
report made by Special Agents Logan and Bramblett, dated December 10,
1963, by placing upon that document the words, "Dallas, Tex., March 24, 1964,
Exhibit 5068, deposition of Capt. C.&nbsp;E. Talbert," and I have signed my name,
and that document&mdash;that exhibit consists just of a single page. And finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
marking upon a report of an interview which you had with Special Agents
Bramblett and Logan of the FBI, on December 12, the following: "Dallas, Tex.,
March 24, 1964, Exhibit 5069, deposition of Capt. C.&nbsp;E. Talbert," under which
I am signing my name. Now, that document consists of eight pages, and I
am marking the seven other pages with my initials on the lower right-hand
corner, on each of the pages. Now, Captain, I ask you if you have had a chance
to study and to read these various documents?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record note, by the way, that Exhibit 5070, is the tour
of the basement which has been previously identified and signed. In a moment
I am going to ask you to identify and endorse your signature or initials below
my signature or initials on each one of these pages of the various documents. In
other words&mdash;in order to separate them, I direct your attention now to Exhibit
5065, being the FBI report of November 24, 1963. As to each one of these documents,
I want to ask you this: Does that document correctly represent the
truth and facts such as you know them? Has anything been deleted? Has
anything been omitted? Do any facts stated need any modification or change of
any sort whatsoever?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. You want me to read them again; do you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just enough to identify them. You have already studied them.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The first document <span class="locked">marked&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 5065?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. 5065. In the last three and a half lines reading: "He said
the press and other news agencies had set up for Oswald's transfer from the
city jail to the county jail, and that day he did not feel the police department
would want to cross the news agencies," and if those were my words it wouldn't
be&mdash;it is probably a matter of semantics. Probably a matter of our conversation
with the sheriff&mdash;after he conversed with me, I had a interview, a brief conversation
with Newsom concerning the fact that chief would contact him upon returning
to city hall, and I do not recall that. I don't recall that. I don't refute it.
I just don't recall it. Shall I initial it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Please. If you will please sign your name under it. I understand,
therefore, that you have no recollection of having said that you doubted that
they were changing the plans because of any fear that they might have of
crossing the press?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Sure, it would be improper, and the&mdash;even an inference of a
statement like that sort would be improper for a police captain to make, and
those are not my words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think you expressed any idea of the same nature, but in
other words?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Perhaps the time lapse, I can't recall, but, as I say, it may
be a matter of semantics, and the way he understood it and what I had said.
As I recall my conversation with him, it was rather difficult to get him back
to the phone. I went through two or three people to get him to the phone, and
as I recall about the conversation, it was rather brief and to the point, that I
had contacted the chief and the chief would contact him when he got to the office,
which would be between 8:30 and 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember discussing any possible change of plans at all
with him?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. None. I discussed no change of plans with Mr. Newsom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you discuss the possibility of a change of plans in the light
of the <span class="locked">new&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall mentioning, in any way, the concept, the basic
concept of that sentence, that is, that the press would be considered whatsoever
in the thinking about those plans for the transfer?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. In conversing with the sheriff, and our conversation either
from the sheriff or from me, and I think probably from the sheriff, the subject
arose that the chief had told the press that they could arrive at the city hall at
10 o'clock, or thereabouts, the previous day, and that was with Sheriff Decker.
Not with Mr. Newsom, as I recall it. Now, I have&mdash;several months have passed
since&mdash;and my memory becomes vague on it, so, must have been&mdash;possibly maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
a matter of semantics, maybe a matter of conversing, or conversation between
Newsom and the sheriff of our having had this brief conversation. Now, the
rest, when you ask if we had any conversation regarding a change of plan in the
transferring, I answered you incorrectly and I don't recall discussing it with
Newsom at all. I did discuss it with Sheriff Decker and said that the chief
would contact him. Any discussion with him was very brief and that the chief
would contact him about the transfer of Oswald when he arrived at the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Have you any other comments to make concerning this
document?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you pass then on back to 5066, which also is an FBI
statement.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir; on this document 5066, it indicates&mdash;and this too is
a matter of semantics, I am thinking. It indicates that Ruby rushed in with
newsmen. That&mdash;shall I read it and finish it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, put the part you read in quotes and end the quote and make
your comments. Just start off with the word "quote" where you want to
start.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. "There were approximately 150 news reporters and television
cameramen that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Closing the quote. The 150, in my opinion, mind, which is relatively fluid, by
the way anybody will estimate a crowd, "150 including police officers, news media
and television cameramen," approximately 150 in the basement. Now, not news
media alone, and&mdash;" He stated in the rush to get down into the basement in
which the loading ramp was located and Oswald was being brought down from
the jail, it is highly possible that Jack Ruby may have been&mdash;walked down the
ramp with the newsmen, unnoticed."</p>

<p>That is, again, something that I couldn't&mdash;could not and would not have
stated, because the newsmen were in the basement. There was no rush of
newsmen into the basement. They were in the basement, and they had been
in the basement some hour before Oswald was brought into the basement.
I don't know how this was injected into this report, but it is incorrect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Have you any other comments to make in regard
to Exhibit 5066?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, "According to Captain Talbert, now, Will Fritz was
in charge about removing Oswald to the Dallas County Jail, and the attempted
removal of the prisoner Oswald about 11 a.m." That was my opinion. Shouldn't
that be inserted there? It was my opinion that Captain Fritz was in charge
of the removal of Oswald from the city jail to the county jail. I had no prior
information on it, and still have no information on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what was the basis of your opinion?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The fact that he wanted him in his office from the jail. He
had taken him out of the jail on a "tempo," which is a temporary release from
the jail to the CID bureau, or CID office, is the fact that he had him out of
the jail at the time is what I based it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. All right, now, have you any further comments on 5066?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would ask you to sign your name below mine and initial
these pages. Have you done that?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, pass then to 5067, and I will ask the same basic questions
as to that document and its several pages.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. 5067, is my report to the chief of police, and I have no
exceptions on it. I read the report, and it is, in fact, similar to one that I
had issued to the chief regarding the incident on the date of the 26th&mdash;November
26th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are initialing now each page below by initial, and you are
signing your name to the first page below my signature?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, will you turn then to Exhibit 5068, and address yourself
to the same basic questions that I asked you originally.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. In Exhibit 5068, I have no exceptions whatsoever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just sign your name below mine then. Finally that brings up
to Exhibit 5069. Do you have any comments to make with reference to that
document?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir; on Exhibit 5069, in there&mdash;and again due to
semantics or to my lack of ability to express myself, some corrections that need
to be made on the first page of 5069. It indicates "Captain Talbert directed
Lieutenant Pierce to call in 3 squads from their district assignments from 3
different stations to take 4 individuals from the headquarters station." The
word "individuals" should be squads.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you weren't talking about 4 people, but 4 squads?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Four patrol squads.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which would constitute a number of <span class="locked">people&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Which I had already directed him to get as many 2-man
squads as possible. I do not have a copy of the details but I could get it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, that's all right.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The actual number&mdash;and on to the next page of the same
exhibit, he added at this time that there were no reserve officers utilized in
the basement of the police building, and that specific arrangements were made to
inspect the vicinity of the basement. There were reserve officers used in the
police building. When it says "basement,"&mdash;there were reserve officers used in
the basement of the police building. This up here about the "CID," I mean the
"detectives," rather than the "supervisor," that should be changed too, and
"Pierce's car," also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are speaking of the fifth page <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Let me initial that down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you were talking about something which appears on the
fifth page of Exhibit 5069, in the top paragraph. Will you read the sentence,
starting with the word "quote" and ending with the word "quote" and then
comment upon the sentence?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. "Captain Talbert could also recall that upon arrival of the
armored car, at the Commerce Street exit a plain car with three detectives were
sent out the Main Street rampway so as to be in position in front of the armored
car for the purpose of escort." The word "detective" should be changed to
"three supervisors," "uniformed supervisors," and those men were Lieutenant
Pierce and&mdash;it identifies them later, but they were uniformed supervisors, and
this 5-minute element here, now, <span class="locked">hold&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. On page 5, of the same exhibit, <span class="locked">quote&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. First, top paragraph?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The top paragraph quote, "Captain Talbert identified the
occupants of this car as being Lieutenant Pierce, who was at that time driving,
Sgt. J.&nbsp;A. Putnam who was in the right front seat, and Sgt. B.&nbsp;J. Maxey, he was
in the left rear seat. He was later informed by Lieutenant Pierce that it was
approximately 5 minutes prior to the shooting of Oswald that they had proceeded
from the basement, left the city hall." That this seems to indicate the
time element from the vehicle leaving the basement, and the time that Oswald
was shot was indicated to me as being 5 minutes. That was incorrect and I
believe now that the indication was that it was approximately 5 minutes from
the time Lieutenant Pierce had left the homicide office until the time Oswald
was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, your recollection is now that what Pierce told
you later was that 5 minutes elapsed from the time of the shooting and the
time prior thereto, that he had left the CID office?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. That's it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whereas, the statement that you have just read and quoted
would indicate that the 5 minutes was between the time of leaving the basement
and the shooting?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you think that it was a mistake, that you did not intend
to convey that idea of what Pierce told you?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. That's quite correct. I didn't intend to convey that idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That, in fact, is your recollection now of what Lieutenant Pierce
told you?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. As I recall now, Lieutenant Pierce told me that from the
time he left the basement until the time&mdash;and from the time he left the basement
ramp and the time he reached the Commerce Street ramp, the shooting had occurred,
and that time lapse would be a minute and three quarters, or 2 minutes
at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall whether Pierce ever talked to you about a 5-minute
interval?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The 5-minute interval, I can't recall; no, sir. I don't recall
that, but if we want to leave it in here it could have been from the time&mdash;it
would have been right from the time he left the homicide office until the
time of the shooting. I don't recall the 5-minute interval. Now, at the time,
it may have happened, but my memory now is&mdash;does not bring it back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, your correction <span class="locked">really&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Is incorrect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is, in a way, incorrect, because you have corrected to refer to
a 5-minute interval and you now tell me that you have no recollection of talking
about a 5-minute lapse at all.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Right, sir. I am merely trying to account for the minutes
there in my <span class="locked">own&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you do not recollect Pierce telling you anything about 5
minutes at all?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I can recall the route he took and where he stopped, but I
can't recall the 5 minutes entering into it at all, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; any further corrections or observations?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Rather a minute one on page 6. Let me get that. That is
about passing out the pads. I don't&mdash;to get that identification&mdash;I don't think
there is any point in answering that.</p>

<p>On page 7, of the same exhibit and the first paragraph, "In regard to this
particular assignment Captain Talbert advised that he was acting on his own
behalf concerning the security measures and it wasn't on instructions by any
particular superior as to what he was or was not to do. At no time prior to
the transfer did Talbert receive specific instructions concerning the details of
the transfer, and most of this information was obtained during the course of
the morning."</p>

<p>In essence, that's true, but to understand the setup of the police function&mdash;I
was the patrol commander on duty during that period and there was no necessity
to give me instructions by anyone in&mdash;any superior or any of my superiors as
to any incident that would require emergency action or restraintive action.
The patrol function is for an emergency function, and to take care of the immediate
difficulties, or immediate trouble. So, it leaves the impression in that
paragraph that someone was derelict in their not informing me prior to that
morning, about not informing me of the course of the transfer and the other
details, when actually, it wasn't necessary. And had Captain Souter or Captain
Frazier been on duty I think they would have taken the same action. This is
a patrol function.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand it, your comment is that what you did was
standard operating procedure?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Standard operating patrol function. If you find trouble
arising, try to offset it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that you would be expected to put into operation such
standard operating procedure?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that they would understand that you would take such
procedures without any particular orders?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the essence of <span class="locked">your&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The essence of what I was trying to convey. And, second
paragraph, same page, it refers, "Captain Talbert continues to say he has
never worked for Jack Ruby in any way whatsoever, but did hear through
rumors that an individual by the name of Cox was alleged to be a reserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
officer, was at one time employed by Jack Ruby." That statement arose from
having read the newspapers in which Cox gave a statement to the newspaper,
the newsmen, and said that he had worked for Jack Ruby. It was not of my
knowledge. I didn't know Cox. We have no police sergeant&mdash;that is supposed
to have been a Sergeant Cox, and we have no police sergeant named Cox.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand your explanation, you do not deny that you
made that statement, but the information you based the statement on you
received from the newspapers and not from your own knowledge at all?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. True, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And do you have any knowledge on the point?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; I still don't know Cox.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any other comments?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. And the fourth paragraph, same page. That is fourth
paragraph, page 7, same exhibit. "In regard to any background information
concerning Jack Ruby, Captain Talbert stated that he was never personally
acquainted with Jack Ruby, and when he did see Jack Ruby, he could only
recall that it was a familiar face. He related that he could not associate the
name with the face, and was not aware that Ruby was a nightclub owner in
Dallas * * *." I intended to convey that the face of Ruby did not associate
itself in my mind with nightclubs in the Dallas area. Although, the name
of Ruby associates itself with a reputation of Ruby by&mdash;as a nightclub operator
in Dallas, quite vividly. I am quite familiar with his nightclubs by name, and
associate the name with the unsavory background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that knowledge concerning Ruby, had you used it prior
to the events of the 24th?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes; that knowledge existed prior to the events of the 24th,
and were police records. And other police officers conveying their information
to me as to activities around his club. I&mdash;around his sister's club out on Oak
Lawn, the Vegas Club and the whole name of Ruby and Ruby's sister and their
operation of their clubs was familiar to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you used the word "unsavory" in connection with him?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Yes, sir; I did. Can she hold this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I'd <span class="locked">rather&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. You can put it in later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Do you have any other things, other comments to
make with reference to it?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Not to that specific exhibit, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; will you then <span class="locked">initial&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I think that is the final one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether it was ever considered moving Ruby
by use of the Main Street basement entrance?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean moving Oswald.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; I had no information on that <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not hear that discussed?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I had&mdash;I never heard any rumors to that effect. Didn't
hear it discussed and I never heard any rumor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything else that you would like to say concerning any
of the matters that we have discussed, Captain Talbert?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. Only say that with the explanation of how the basement
has been secured, and my personal examination of the basement, I was of the
opinion that no unauthorized person could enter that basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To what did you attribute the failure of the security?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The final reason, or the official investigation is one that
I can't refute, and I am sure you are familiar with it, that Officer Vaughn on
the Main Street entrance stepped out to the curb as Lieutenant Pierce pulled the
plain car out to put it in front of the armored car just prior to the shooting,
and that is the route that Ruby said he took into the station, and it&mdash;as far as
any investigation has been, that is the route he took. I <span class="locked">can't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is no positive evidence indicating any other route?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir; and the only&mdash;hold it a minute. I want&mdash;there
was an extra police officer standing&mdash;still wanted in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, all right.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything else you would like to add other than what
we have talked about?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. My primary concern that morning was with the crowd control,
the mob control. Our warning had been against a possible larger group
of people taking Ruby away from the officers. They had told <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean Oswald?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I'm sorry. Taking Oswald away from the officers. They
had been told, the person who answered the phone in the FBI office, that he
wanted the information transmitted to the police department that no police
officers would be injured, and, of course, that was discounted as no police
officer being injured by it, but nevertheless, the crowd action was highly probable,
and our primary objective was to prevent, or control, crowd action. I had
a total of three gas grenade kits and projectile kits in the basement, that is my
own, and the officer's riot guns, if that becomes necessary, although, the crowd
can be controlled by gas if we couldn't do it with brute force, we could do it
with gas. But the event that did occur, where one person dashed out of a crowd
and shot a person and literally laid down, said, "Here I am. I did it," in pride
was rather stunning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, captain, have you been interviewed by any member of
the Commission other than the interview that you have had with me?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As to the interview with me, now, there was one yesterday,
I think that is about it, is that right?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They&mdash;the one with you yesterday and this one has been the
only interview?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. The only interview has been with you yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, is there anything that you can think of between the deposition
you have given today and the interview we had, which is inconsistent
with one another?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you, or did you provide any material or facts in any of
the interviews which haven't been developed on the record?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Then one final thing; is there anything else you wish
to say?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I don't think there is anything else I could say that would
add materially to your investigation, sir. It is&mdash;if there were, I'd be delighted to
do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If something should occur to you which has not been covered
here or in any other report, I want you to feel free to contact us and tell
us that you want to add what should be added.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Talbert</span>. I would do so immediately. There is no one more concerned
with finding out how Ruby got in the basement to shoot Oswald than
myself, so, I am with you. I would love to find out how he got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I certainly thank you, and on behalf of the Commission, I want
to thank you for your cooperation and time.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="COA">TESTIMONY OF CHARLES OLIVER ARNETT</h2>

<p>The testimony of Charles Oliver Arnett was taken at 8 p.m., on March 25,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission. Robert T. Davis, assistant attorney general of Texas,
was present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am Burt Griffin, and I am a member of the advisory staff
of the general counsel's office for the President's Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy. The Commission itself was set up under an Executive
order issued by President Johnson and congressional resolution passed
by Congress.</p>

<p>Pursuant to these official acts, the Commission itself has promulgated a set
of rules of procedure, and under these rules of procedure I have been authorized
to come here and take your sworn deposition. Captain Arnett, I want to
explain to you a little bit of the general nature of our inquiry here. We are
concerned with the assassination of President Kennedy and the final death of
Lee Harvey Oswald, and we have been empowered and requested by the President
to investigate all the facts and evaluate and then report this back to
the President.</p>

<p>We have asked you to come here because we believe that you may have some
facts that might be pertinent, particularly to the death of Lee Oswald. However,
we are also concerned with the entire picture in the examination, and
if there is anything that you think would be helpful to us, why, of course, we
want to take that. Mr. Hubert and myself are not working on an intensive basis
on the other aspects of things, outside of Ruby. So what I will do is ask
you a few general things which might have some bearing upon the death of
the President that would enable other people to look at it and see if you were
somebody that might have information, and then we will get into the other
problems.</p>

<p>Now, the mechanics by which we asked you to come here by, the general
counsel of the Commission sent a letter to Chief Curry indicating that we
would like to talk to you and certain other police officers. Actually, under the
rules of the Commission you are entitled to have a written letter from the
Commission, 3 days in advance of your testimony here, but the rules also
provide that you can waive this notice. Before I swear you in, I would like
to ask you if you are willing to waive the notice provision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you are also entitled to have an attorney, and I see that
you don't have an attorney, and I take it that you don't want one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, do you have any questions you would like to ask me
about the thing before I swear you in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you raise your right hand? Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you give the court reporter your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Charles Oliver Arnett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And when were you born, Mr. Arnett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. September 6, 1911.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And where do you live now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. 1223 South Waverly Drive, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you are employed with the Dallas Police Department, is
that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No. I am a captain on the reserve.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, will you explain what the difference is between the reserve
and the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes sir. Reserves were established about 10 or 11 years ago,
to assist in, say, tornadoes or, you know, something that came up that they
needed more help in to be trained on that. We don't draw any pay from the
Dallas Police Department at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who does pay you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Nobody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is a completely voluntary thing on your part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it you have a regular occupation on the side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir; I drive a truck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And for whom do you work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Certain-Teed Products Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Fourteen years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been in the police reserve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. A little over 10 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, have you had any special training in connection with your
duties in the police reserve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir; went through school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us a little bit about that school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, when I was going through, we went on Friday night, I
believe it takes 7½ months, if I remember right, to complete the course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long ago was this that you went through the school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, it's been a little over 10 years now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you went every Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. For how many hours a night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Two hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And as a result you became an officer in the reserve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, since you have been in the reserve, how frequently would
you be called to duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I was a sergeant to start with. We had 2 nights a month,
I believe it was, that we were assigned to be here. You could come more times
than that if you had the opportunity. Then I made lieutenant, which put me over
more men, and April 6, either 3 or 4 years ago, I was made captain, and I have,
I believe 80 some odd men under my company B. I am captain over company B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after you go through the training school, do your men
engage in regular training of any sort, with the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well they ride on the squads and observe what's going on and
special things like Texas-Oklahoma football rally. We work in that. State
Fair of Texas. Usually somebody assigned to that every night during the
Fair, and such as the President's parade. There were, I believe say 30 some
odd&mdash;27 or 28, I believe it was, was assigned to that. Just things like that,
or what we are assigned to, and then we have our regular nights that we ride
squads, that we ride with squads or <span class="locked">whatever&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. How often are you assigned to ride squads?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, the patrolmen usually ride on their regular nights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that once a week or once every 2 weeks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Now, they are assigned twice a month, but if they have the
time they usually come down once a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And for how long do they ride?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Oh, usually report around 7 or 7:30 at night until 10:30, 11 o'clock.
Some of them ride longer than that, but that's the usual case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are they in uniform at that time when they ride?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do they receive any pay for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, are there any other training programs that these men
undergo once they have gone through the initial 7-month program?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, each fall they go out to the pistol range. I would say for
four or five Saturdays, something like that. I might be off a week or something
like that, but somewhere in that neighborhood, for training out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anything else you can think of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, right offhand, I don't believe there are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I want to mark these couple of documents here, and then
we will talk about these [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark what is an interview that you had with two
agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Mabey and Mr. Kenneth P.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Hughes, on December 4, 1963. I am going to mark that Dallas, Tex., C.&nbsp;O.
Arnett, 3-25-64, Exhibit 5032. And the next document that I am going to mark
is what purports to be a copy of a letter that you prepared&mdash;signed, rather,
dated November 27, 1963, and addressed to Chief Curry, having to do with the
events that you observed on November 24, 1963. I am going to mark that
Dallas, Tex., C.&nbsp;O. Arnett, 3-25-64, Exhibit 5033. Now, I am going to hand
these two exhibits to you, Captain Arnett, and I want to ask you if you have
examined those. Have you had a chance to read them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, are there any additions or corrections, changes that you
want to make in those, after having had a chance to read them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Tell us where they are and we will see if we can't
do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Right here. "He was stationed at the door of Chief Curry's
office&mdash;" [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, this is on Exhibit 5032, and you are referring
to the language in the second paragraph on the first page. You stated that
you were stationed in the door of Chief Curry's office. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I was stationed at Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. See, they have got it wrong. They have got it down Chief
Curry, when it was Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Would you take my pen, then, and make the change
on there, and cross out what's wrong and make an entry nearby to indicate
what's correct, and then initial it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Just scratch out this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I would say scratch out Chief Curry and write in Captain
Fritz, if that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. How do you spell Fritz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. [Spelling] F-r-i-t-z.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. [Spelling] F-r-i-t-z?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Apostrophe s, I guess. [Spelling] F-r-i-t-z-'-s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you initial, put your initials by each one of those changes
and put a date out there, 3-25-64. Are there any other corrections that you
think ought to be made there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't remember any right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Now, did you serve in connection with the President's
parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Was I at the parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any duties as a reserve officer in connection with
President Kennedy's arrival?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you tell us what those duties were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I was at large, but I worked between Harwood and St. Paul, on
Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when were you first told that you would have some responsibility
in connection with the procession of the President through Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, probably the day before. I am not going to say that for
sure. I could be wrong a day or two, but I think it was the day before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you have any men that you were responsible for
supervising?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many men did you supervise on that particular day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. If I remember right, we had 27 or 28 reserves in the detail.
We assigned them out of the assembly room to various locations up and down
where the parade would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you attend any meeting prior to November 22, in which
you got instructions as to what you were going to do in connection with the
parade?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir; other than the assembly room that morning, when we
assigned the men out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you arrived at the police department on the morning
of November 22, what time was it that you got there, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, it seems like it was around 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, prior to 10 o'clock on November 22, had you received any
instructions as to what your duties were going to be, in particular with respect
to the parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Other than just work in the parade is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. When you arrived, who did you report to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. To the assembly room. And right offhand, now, I can't tell
you who was in charge of the regular officers. At that time I knew, and it seems
to me like it was Lieutenant &mdash;&mdash;. I can't recall his name right now. Maybe
I will think of it directly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, that's all right. Was there a meeting of all the reserve
officers in the assembly room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you receive instructions at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. At that time they were each one assigned their location to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. And not to&mdash;if they was booing the President or not&mdash;you know,
getting out of line or anything, not to bother anybody, but if you saw anybody
that was&mdash;acted as though they was going to bodily harm&mdash;you know, injure
body, well, to notify the police officer, regular officers, you know, of what was
going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall who gave&mdash;you say this was the lieutenant
that gave these instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It was a lieutenant that assigned us out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember who gave you these instructions that you are
talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It seems like it was Captain Lawrence, but I couldn't swear to
that, but <span class="locked">it's&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Captain Solomon have any responsibility in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It may have been Captain Solomon that gave us that. It was
a captain, I am almost certain and I feel like&mdash;I know Captain Solomon was
in the building, in the meeting with us, and it could have been him that gave
us instructions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. The instructions that were given, did they have
to do with anything other than watching the crowd, were you instructed to
watch any other places besides the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. You mean any particular buildings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or just buildings generally; were you instructed to watch
the windows in buildings or watch the roofs or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I wouldn't say that anything like that in particular was
named, but it was, you know, to watch and see&mdash;keep the crowd back out of
the street and see that nobody, you know, rushed out there against the President's
car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, had you served in connection with other parades?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any other Presidential or political parades like this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. At one time Vice President Nixon came to the opening of the
Fair, and I was there for that. Some man walked up to me and told me
that he would like to present a pair of boots to the Vice President. A Secret
Service man, I suppose, was standing close enough that he heard what the
man said to me, and he asked me what the man said, and I told him, and he
said, "Certainly he can't give him a pair of boots. Get his name and address
and if he wants to mail the Vice President a pair of boots he can later."
That's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, the instructions that were given down in the assembly
room, did they differ in any way from the instructions that would normally
be given at any other parade that you worked in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I wouldn't think so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I mean at other parades was it the custom to bring you into the
assembly room <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then give instructions as to what you should do and what to
watch out for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were any of the men under your supervision assigned to the
area of the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whether there were any men at all of the reserve
officers assigned to the area of the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't recall any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, the fact that you don't recall; would you have been
made aware of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I had a list of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You did. And did that list show the areas where they were
assigned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you still have a copy of that list?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Captain Solomon does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, on this list did it show where each particular man was to
stand, was to be placed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. They would either be on the west side of Harwood or they would
be on the east side of Harwood, between block so-and-so; Main the same way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But would it show Charles O. Arnett, corner of Main and Harwood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I was working at large.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, would it show, if I were working there, would it show Burt
W. Griffin, corner of Main and Harwood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. What did you do when you heard that the President
had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Had an aunt that was to be buried at 2 o'clock that afternoon,
and the President's parade was later than it had been predicted, and when it was
over with, prior to the President's arrival at the&mdash;between Harwood and Pacific
on Main, a young lady in her twenties, maybe 30 years old, came up to me and
said, "There is some kids right down there that's got a gun and some toy handcuffs
and a knife." I said, "Would you show them to me?" She said "Well, I
rather not." So I went and got Earl Sawyer, a police officer that was working
the corner of Harwood and Main, and told him of it. He and I went back to
the lady and he asked her. She said, "Oh, it's just a toy pistol." But some
little girls there with us told us where they were, about where they were standing,
and we walked up to them, asked them about the gun and stuff. They said
the boy with the gun had walked off, but one of them give us a pair of handcuffs
and a knife, and I taken him, and Sawyer went with me, and we carried him to
the juvenile department up on the third floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that a real knife that the kid had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir. The gun turned out to be a blank, like they shoot&mdash;oh,
at starting races or something like that, you know. When the parade was past
us, one of these smaller boys that was in the group come up to me and asked me
when his buddy would be turned loose. I said, "I don't know, son, but I will go
up there with you to try to find out where he is." So we went up there on the
third floor of the juvenile department. While I was in there someone rushed
in and said, "The President has been shot."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was up there with you at that time in the juvenile department;
do you recall any of the officers that were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No; I believe Captain Martin&mdash;now, I could be wrong on the
name, but he is over the juvenile department, or was. You know, the captain
that they&mdash;that had the kid that we had carried up there. So I came back
downstairs then and I saw two or three highway patrol, driver's license <span class="locked">men&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me interrupt here just a second, give you a few names of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
people who were in that department, juvenile department, and see if you recognize
any of those as having been present. Was Detective Lowery there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't remember him being. Now, he may have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Officer Goolsby there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't recall him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Detective Miller there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I couldn't say, and I wouldn't say without telling you the
truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; do you know L.&nbsp;D. Miller, Louis D. Miller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't know whether I do or not. I do know Lowery, and I do
know the <span class="locked">officer&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Lowery and Goolsby. How about the Officer Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Blackie Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Blackie Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he there at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't recall him being there at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you go after you left the boy in the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That was when I carried the second boy up to see about his
buddy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I went downstairs and on the street. As I say, I saw three or
four Texas Highway Department driver's license men, and I said, "The President
has been shot." And they said, "Oh, Arnett, what size camera was he
shooting?" They thought, you know, I was joking. So I went on and got in
my car. By that time squads were going everywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this your private car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes; went home to change clothes out of my uniform into civilian
clothes, to go to my aunt's funeral.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, which way did you drive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I believe I went down Young Street. I did. I went down Young
Street to avoid all this traffic of squads and everything <span class="locked">going&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Young Street in what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. West.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Headed west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir. Over the Houston Street viaduct to Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Does Young intersect Jackson any place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Jackson runs along beside it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Runs parallel to it. Did you go by the Greyhound Bus station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Did I go by it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I would have been one block south of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what time would you estimate that it was that you went
over the Houston Street viaduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I would say it was shortly before 1 o'clock, because I had to
rush to get out of these clothes into other clothes to get to Grapevine, which
is only 20 miles, something like that, to be there at 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got across the Houston Street viaduct, is there
a point where you come to Zangs Boulevard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go to Zangs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I went Zangs to Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you get to the corner of Zangs and Beckley at any point in
your trip out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No. Beckley would have been a block east of where I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you drove this route, did you see anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of any importance to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, I take it then you went on out to the funeral,
or wherever you had to go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I went on home. I had my police radio on. Before I arrived at
my home I heard someone come in on the radio and say, "A police officer has
been shot." And further, maybe a block or two, he says, "I believe he is dead."
And I changed my clothes right quick and got in my car to go to Grapevine. I
came back down Clarendon to the R.&nbsp;L. Thornton Expressway, taken R.&nbsp;L.
Thornton Expressway to Highway 114&mdash;well, it turns into Stemmons Expressway,
you know, automatically, Highway 114, and I was listening all the time of this
transaction of the police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you listening on a police radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Let me ask you this, this is your own private car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does the police radio broadcast over a frequency that can be
heard on ordinary radio receivers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of special adaptation do you have to have on your
receiver to pick this up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. They call it a converter. It's hooked in with your radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this an FM converter; do they broadcast on an FM frequency,
do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, seems to me like it used to be AM and you could pick it up
then by having your radio fixed a certain way, but they quit that. You
couldn't do it no more, so you had to buy this converter to go with your radio
to get it. And I listened to the move from the library over in Oak Cliff to the
Texas Theater, and was listening to it when they got him, but I was at Grapevine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear the automobiles called in from the outlying districts
over your radio, when you were listening to it; did you hear any communications
from the dispatcher or otherwise, calling police cars in from the
outlying districts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. They were giving a description of the man that they had a
description on, and then after the policeman was shot, Tippit, well, they was
giving the description of it, and they first thought he was in the library over in
Oak Cliff. Then they moved to a vacant house, then they moved to the Texas
Theater.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, did you go back to the police station on Friday,
after you heard that Tippit had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. After the funeral, after my aunt's funeral was over, I came home,
ate supper and went back in uniform, came back down here and worked on the
third floor at the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time would you estimate that you arrived at the third
floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I would say 6 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at the time that you arrived at the elevator, had there
been a system set up for admitting people to the third floor&mdash;let's put it this
way, excluding people from the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That's what I started doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was there anybody else doing that at the elevator before
you arrived, before you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I couldn't say whether there was anybody assigned there before
I got there or not, but there was a Sergeant Ellis, I believe, and Sergeant Dugger,
were there with me when I was working there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Did you replace anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Now, I am not going to say that I did or I didn't, because I
couldn't tell you and be telling you the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you get your instructions from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I believe it was Sergeant Ellis, I believe it was, now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is he a regular sergeant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you ride on the elevator?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir. I was in front of it, and as people got off they had to
show their identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Did you recognize Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Did I recognize him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; I mean, did you know Jack Ruby up to this point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of identification did you ask for when people got off
of the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, if they was a press reporter, they had a press card, showing
who they were, and they were from everywhere, coming in there. You would
be surprised how far they had traveled that day. You know, I was&mdash;I didn't
think about people being there that day, you know, from so far up. One man
told me he was asleep in Chicago. They woke him up and told him the President
had been killed, and he was there that night, I would say by 8 o'clock. There
was one man in particular that I remember, that came up. He said he was a
postal inspector.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Postal inspector?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. He showed me his identification, said he would like to talk to
Captain Fritz, that he had a key to the post office box down there that this
fellow had, and he wanted to see if that key did fit it, or he had a key and he
wanted to see if it would&mdash;was to that box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how many of you were standing there at the third floor
elevator, checking identification of people who got off the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I would say four. Two elevators.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do about people who came up, who said they
came up to see somebody who was being questioned, or in connection with
some other business other than being a photographer <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. If they didn't have an identification of pressmen or ranger or
lawmen of some kind, they were turned back. There were two Spanish men
came up there who wanted to talk to some officer about a ticket, and we notified
whatever officer they wanted to talk to about it, and told him to go downstairs
and see them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Suppose somebody had showed you a justice of the peace card,
would you have admitted him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. A justice of the peace?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Suppose somebody had showed you a card that said he was an
honorary deputy sheriff, or a courtesy card, some of the law enforcement agents
give out, are you familiar with those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Suppose someone had showed you one of those, would you have
let him in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I wouldn't let anybody in who didn't have proper identification,
without notifying one of these regular officers standing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you have considered this a proper identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't remember having that come up. Now, there were two
or three rangers there. One of them from Gainesville, Tex. I talked to him
a little bit and the captain of the rangers was there. I don't know where he
was from. He might have been from Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any lawyers come up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Lawyers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't remember any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any newspaper people come up who didn't show
you press cards who appeared to be newspaper people from the way they
conducted themselves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Two or three different times a news reporter would come up
and show a press card and say, "I have got a friend with me that's just with
me". I said he would just have to wait downstairs, and they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, you know, a number of police officers have stated that
they saw Jack Ruby up on the third floor on Friday evening. How do you
imagine that Ruby could have got by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't know. After I was there that afternoon or that night, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
would say. I wasn't in the afternoon, because I was at that funeral, but I
don't believe Jack Ruby got up there after that time of night. I didn't see
Jack Ruby the entire time of that thing, until he was in front of me in the
basement, the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you have recognized him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you remain at the elevator doors all of the time you
were on duty on Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I would say I was there until around 11 o'clock that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After 11 o'clock what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I went home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anybody replace you on those doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you give him any instructions as to what he was to do in
admitting people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you come in on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time did you come in on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Around 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how late did you stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Until about 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you do the same sort of thing on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That afternoon I didn't work in front of the elevators, but I
did work over where the stairways are. There is a stairway that you can
walk down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I worked there with an officer. I believe his initials is L.&nbsp;M.
Baker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there came a time Saturday night when you were stationed
by Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I would say around 7 or 8 o'clock that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you notice while you were there whether any newspaper
people were going in to use the telephone in the homicide office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say you were stationed outside Captain Fritz' door. Do
you mean that you were inside the homicide office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No; I was outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, you were stationed outside of the homicide
door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. In the hallway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, that wasn't really the door to Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No; his office is back inside, but you had to go through that door
to get to his office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wonder if it wouldn't be clearer if we even edited this other,
instead of Captain Fritz, if we crossed that out and said to the door to the
homicide office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. All right. Go ahead and write it in if you want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Let me mark it [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That would sound more reasonable, sensible, anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, would you initial those two places and date them where I
marked them [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir. We got the date, is that all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That's okay. All right. Now, did you see newspapermen going
in to use the telephone in other offices besides the homicide bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, really I just tell you the truth, there were so many people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
in there and out&mdash;what I mean, there was a crowd there, and as far as seeing
what was going on in other offices, I couldn't tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did there come a time on Saturday night when you received
some instructions from one of the other officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Did there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you call Lieutenant Merrell sometime that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, about what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It seemed to me like it was around 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. And what did Lieutenant Merrell tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That Captain Solomon had called him and asked to get a few
reserves down there the next morning to help with the transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, where was this told to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It was told to me there at the door, to call Lieutenant Merrell.
I am trying to think where I went and called from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Somebody came up to you at the homicide <span class="locked">office&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And said, "Call Lieutenant Merrell"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then you went and made a telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I believe I went in Chief Curry's&mdash;not in his office, now, but into
the room where all the secretaries and everything are, and used the telephone.
I am almost certain I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you call Merrell some place outside of the building <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. He was at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He was at home. Is he a regular officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. He is a reserve lieutenant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He is a reserve lieutenant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. He is my assistant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then Merrell told you that you would have to have some men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That they wanted some men, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So somebody apparently had called Merrell to tell him that, is
that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Captain Solomon, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Captain Solomon had called Merrell. Now, did you attempt to
locate some reserves that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you attempt to locate reserves that were already in the
police department building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I called Lieutenant McCoy, who was on duty, riding in a squad
car, put out a call for him to call me at the office, and he did, and I gave him
those instructions, to call some of his men the next morning to be there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what time did you tell Lieutenant McCoy that the men
should be there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Nine o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at this point did you have any understanding as to generally
when Oswald would be moved; did you have any idea generally when he would
be moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Chief Curry told the newsmen that if they were back by 10 o'clock
they would be plenty early.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear Chief Curry tell them that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Other than what you heard Chief Curry say, did you receive any
other information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Of what time it would be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you have your conversations with Lieutenant Merrell
and Lieutenant McCoy before or after Chief Curry made the announcement to
the press?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I would say it was probably a few minutes before I heard him
say that. I could be wrong about it. I am trying to, you know, think whether
it was or wasn't, but I am not certain about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, the call that you issued to Lieutenant McCoy, would that
have gone through the dispatcher's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. For him to call me would&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And they would have made a record of that, isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It would have been recorded, but our conversation wouldn't have
been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If we were to look at that record, would that be the most accurate
reflection of the approximate time that you had information concerning the
transfer of Oswald; in other words, is that the most <span class="locked">accurate&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It would be recorded all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. My question is, we want to try to find out just exactly how soon
people would have known that something was going to happen.</p>

<p>Now, is that record, that would be in the dispatcher's office the most accurate
or earliest record that would have been made of anything you did in connection
with the information you received about the move, that Oswald was going to be
moved the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, it would show&mdash;you would have to first check and see what
squad McCoy was riding, to get the number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. You see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It wouldn't go out to McCoy specifically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No; it would go to the squad he was riding with. His name
wouldn't have been on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But now, would the dispatcher's statement over the radio, would
that say number such-and-such call number such-and-such, or would it say
number such-and-such call Captain Arnett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No; I believe it would have said call the office. I don't believe our
names would have been mentioned on the air.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, would there be a record of some kind that we
could use to find out what number designated Lieutenant McCoy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, there would be a work sheet, assignment sheet, of what
squad he was riding in that night, the number of it. For instance, we will just
say 243 or 242 or&mdash;I don't know what number it was now, but I am just saying
those numbers, that it's possible he could have been in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well now, do you know how long records of that sort are retained
by the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I suppose they are kept for a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what time was it that you arrived at the Police and Courts
Building the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Nine o'clock a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. How many men would you estimate that you contacted
about this between the time that you got the word from Lieutenant
Merrell and the time you arrived at 9 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. If I remember right, I called Lieutenant Merrell&mdash;I mean Lieutenant
McCoy, and I saw Lieutenant Nicholson and told him to call some of his
men. If I remember right, though, those are the only two people I contacted
on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, would Lieutenant Merrell have had occasion to contact any
other officers, to give instructions to men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. He could have called some of the sergeants and told them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Would there have been any other captains who would
have given instructions similar to ones you gave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, there are three more captains, but so far as I know there
wasn't any contacted, unless it was Captain Crump and I didn't contact him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. How many men did you attempt to get in that next
morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I told them to have 8 or 9 to 10 men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Each; each lieutenant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No; each one just get two or three men. We had 18.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had 18 all together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Uh, huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you remember where you parked your car before you
came in the building on Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I either put it in the parking station west of the city hall on
Commerce Street or I parked it on the side street of Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember entering the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Do I remember entering the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what entrance you came through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir. Down in the basement, from Commerce Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as you walked down that Commerce Street entrance, at
that time were there any TV cables strung through there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. The cameras were set up on the Commerce side, out there, and I
do believe that there were cables running through the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there is one door there that enters into the hallway that
runs to the records room, as you get down the bottom of the steps from Commerce
Street, you open up the door and you can go down a hallway toward the records
room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Down that way [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Going north?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Uh, huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there are also in there, at the bottom of those steps from
the street, two other doors; do you recall that there are two other doors there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. They would be on Harwood Street, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. You mean there are two more doors on Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. One of them leads to the engine room. Are you familiar
with that door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Another one leads into the subbasement. Are you familiar
with that door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Now, that's the one I am talking about I came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You went down into the subbasement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. See here, this is Commerce Street, and you walk down a flight
of steps, and there is a door, and you are going right towards the records
building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, there is a subbasement to that building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No; I misunderstand what you are talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you familiar with the subbasement in the&mdash;where the police
officers' locker room is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes. Oh, yes. If that's what you are talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Were you aware of the fact that there was a door
that led up from the subbasement right up under the stairs, on the Commerce
Street side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't know whether I understand what you mean or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You walk off of the sidewalk on Commerce <span class="locked">Street&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. And go down in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And go down in the basement, you get down there in the basement
and there is a door that goes into the hallway that runs up to the records
room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there are two other doors in that area. One of them is,
if I am not mistaken, off to the right, as you face the hallway, and that goes into
the engine room; and there is another area&mdash;door, rather, sort of at your back,
as you look down that hallway, and that goes down in the subbasement. Were
you aware of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you would have no recollection of whether any of the TV
wires were strung any place except through the hallway to the records room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No; I sure wouldn't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Now, when you entered there, where did you go&mdash;and
got inside the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I saw Lieutenant Wiggins, and he asked me if I could replace
one of his regular men that was out there behind the TV cameras that&mdash;in other
words, this is the basement [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, I think I can help you out here. Here is a diagram of
the basement, and here is the jail office and here is the parking area, here is
the ramp from Main Street, here is the ramp going up to Commerce Street
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. We have got it turned right around to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, whichever way is easiest for you. All right. Now, this
is coming down from Main. That's Main [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. This is Commerce going out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. All right. The TV cameras were set up right in here. They
wanted to keep this open here. They didn't want any cars parking in here
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me draw two TV cameras; is that about where they were
placed, where I have got them there [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, behind the TV <span class="locked">cameras&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It's wide enough for two automobiles to park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Was there a man stationed behind those two TV
cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. There was a regular and they needed him out there, so I put
a reserve officer out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was that reserve officer that you put there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Worley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now. I am going to put an X&mdash;well, you put an X
on the map where you think Worley was, and write his name in there, if you will,
please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. [Spelling] <span class="locked">W-o&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. [Spelling] W-o-r-l-e-y.</p>

<p>Now, what's your best estimate of what time it was that you put Worley in
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Shortly after 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to say whatever it was, 9:15, whatever you think it
was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, this may not be exact on the minute, but it will be within
5 minutes or so [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I am going to put 9:10 [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Because I did it as quick as I could after I was asked to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, what did you do after you placed Worley
at that spot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I went into the assembly room, and there were a few men in
there. I walked back outside and I believe that I talked to some captain that
needed five men down at the Elm-Houston Street viaduct, and I went back in and
asked them if they could send five men down there and they said yes. They
assigned five men to go down there and they were sent down there in a squad
car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. After that, I got some more men out of the assembly room.
They were just coming in, you know, and Sergeant Dean and Sergeant Putnam,
we searched the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, did you accompany Sergeant Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you accompany him all the way around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. In this area, I did [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That's the area, sort of the Main Street portion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That's it (indicating).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go with Sergeant Dean to the area that's marked on
the map stairs up, behind elevators No. 1 and No. 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Did I go up the stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No. Did you go to that area with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, this is the area I covered with him, from here, all this
right in here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The reporter can't see that, but you are indicating&mdash;we have
to get this down in words, so that the members of the Commission, Chief Justice
Warren and so forth will understand what we are talking about here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are indicating that you searched with Sergeant Dean that
portion of the garage which includes the elevators No. 1 and No. 2 and the doorway
to the stair up, correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got to those elevators, what did you and Sergeant
Dean do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. As we searched them out, we placed men in this area as we
searched it out, there was a regular officer stationed here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Regular officer <span class="locked">stationed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. At the elevators [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to put on the map where that regular officer was,
and put an X there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It was here in front of these elevators [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you want to write regular officer&mdash;do you know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir; I don't. [Spelling] <span class="locked">R-e&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Regular, yes. All right. Now, were these elevators operating,
these elevators No. 1 and No. 2, were they in operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I couldn't say whether they were or not. They wasn't working
at the time I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. You didn't see any boys, Negro boys in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there a door at this entranceway to the stairs up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Did you say are there a door there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there a door there; do you remember if there is a door there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. There is a door here that goes into this [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Into the first aid station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir. But now, I couldn't say whether there are or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Do you recall what investigation was made in the
area of that doorway there, toward the stairs up? What check you and Sergeant
Dean made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, they probably were finishing their investigation here and
we were back over here. There is a building extends out from the walls, and
it doesn't go completely back against this ramp. There is room for a man to
walk in there, and I went and got a flashlight <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I want to talk about this area right here. Do you recall
whether you and Sergeant Dean went over to that doorway that leads to the
stairs up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn't go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Right. Did you go to that area where the first-aid station is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I didn't make that part of the search there. We started and
came around this way, searched all these cars down through here, and this
building back here that I am telling you about, that doesn't extend against the
wall. I went and got a flashlight and Sergeant &mdash;&mdash; I will think of his name
in a minute, reserve. His name starts with a H.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, that's okay. His name isn't necessary. You went back
there searched <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. We taken a flashlight in there and I held the flashlight for him,
and he got up in there and I give him the flashlight, and he taken the flashlight
and walked all back in here. There was room for a man to walk in there
[indicating].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The area you are indicating is an area behind the jail <span class="locked">office&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No; it's not behind it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, here is the jail office [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, the one I am talking about, here is the ramp, see, and the
one I am talking about is like this, doesn't go completely against the ramp.
There is room for a man to walk in behind there [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, other than this northern portion of the basement, did
you search any other area with Sergeant Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir. I stayed right in here. Some more reserves came in
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you tell me where I was?</p>

<p>(The record was here read by the reporter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After you searched the basement, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. After I searched this portion of the basement [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I stayed right here. That's where the cars come in and out
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, would you place an A where you stationed yourself after
the search of the basement, and would you put a circle around that; would you
write around that, after search of basement [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. [Spelling] <span class="locked">B-a-s-p&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. [Spelling] B-a-s-e-m-e-n-t. Now, captain, how long did you
remain there at that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Oh, it seems like 10 or 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. J.&nbsp;C. Hunt took my place, another reserve officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Replaced by J.&nbsp;C. Hunt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Hunt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After about 15 minutes. Now, then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I had sent some men <span class="locked">outside&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I went to different ones that were, you know, around in here, of
the reserves [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You circulated in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. In the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you make assignments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What assignments did you make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I sent Sergeant Cox and Sergeant &mdash;&mdash; this little sergeant that
I was trying to name while ago&mdash;Could I call the man and ask him that boy's
name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That's not really important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It isn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; did you assign people outside of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you make assignments to the various intersections?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. To keep people back. They were over here on the Commerce
south-side street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Keep people back off, on the sidewalk, and not let them on the
street [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You sent all your men to Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No; not all of them. I sent three men up there at that particular
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you send your other men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, earlier, before this, I sent one to Commerce and Pearl
to work a signal light that had gone out of order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever assign anybody to Main and Pearl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Main and Pearl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever assign anybody to Elm and Pearl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Not before the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Did you make any assignments on Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Did you make any assignment on Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't remember of any. I did have a man in front of the
Credit Building&mdash;what do they call it, the Employees Credit Association or
Credit Union or something another. I did have a man up on the ramp of it.
That's out on Commerce Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you assign Mr. Newman to a place in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I didn't make the assignment myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you leave the basement at any time after this particular
period that we are talking about, when you made these assignments, did
you leave the basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't believe so. Not until after the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. While you were in the basement, were you in the
garage and ramp area the entire time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. After I left this particular spot here [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; where we marked the A?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I was in this area right in here, and about 11:05 I took my
stand right in here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, you spent your entire time then in <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Area between the entrance to the garage at the bottom of the
Commerce Street ramp and the portion where the Main Street ramp narrows
at the bottom, or widens out at the bottom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. [No response.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, would you put a mark on the map where you were, where
you stationed yourself at about 11:05?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Let's see if we understand each other here on this. Is this
the office where they come out of the jail [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. And this comes out so far and then this is the ramp [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. All right. I was right along in here then [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you put an A there, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Okay [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And put a circle around that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. All right [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, would you mark the time that you think you first arrived
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I would say 11:05.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. How do you fix that time 11:05?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I believe I looked at my watch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you write up a report on this on November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Did I write it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I made the statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you write a letter to Chief Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, that's the letter [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you didn't mention in that letter anything about 11:05.
Was the first time that you thought about 11:05 when you were interviewed by
the FBI agents on December 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. You mean was that the first time I thought about it being 11:05
when I went there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, no; I wouldn't say it was the first time I thought about
it. It might have been that I didn't think about it when I was writing that
letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, captain, if you were to place the time that you stationed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
yourself here, in terms of how much before&mdash;well, in terms of the time that
the armored car was in the ramp, did you place yourself before <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It was here before I went there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. This was after the armored car arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how long before Lee Oswald was brought down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. After I placed myself over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, around 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what time Oswald was brought down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I know what time the ambulance was called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. 11:21.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you stationed yourself at that point, were the floodlights
from the TV cameras on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Were they on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. If I remember right, they had been on all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. They had been on all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. They wasn't alive all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mean the cameras weren't alive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time you searched the basement, were the floodlights
on from those TV cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well now, whether they were on or not, I don't know. I believe
the machine was lighted up. Now, whether that's what you <span class="locked">call&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; I mean the floodlights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I am not going to say either way on that, because I am
not going to tell you anything I don't think is the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you sure the floodlights were on when you stationed yourself
at the point that we have marked as point A at the bottom of the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I would say lights were on. Now, whether they were floodlights
or not, I couldn't tell you. I don't know whether you say just a light
fitting there was a floodlight or the lights in the camera <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; I am talking about the lights they use to illuminate the
picture they are going to take, throw out on the subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I will say the cameras had a light in them. I will say that.
Now, whether you call them floodlights or not, I don't know. Now, they tell
me that they can be on and not be taking pictures unless there is a red light
burning. Now, whether that's true or not, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Over where these TV cameras are, were there some
lights placed in association with those cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. All I can remember of, and I am trying to tell you the <span class="locked">truth&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Is that the light was on in the camera. You know what I
mean, that [indicating] was burning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don't know if you have taken home movies or anything like
that, or just had your picture taken in a photographer's studio, often they
beam a lot of lights down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I know what you are talking about there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any lights like that over by these TV cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't remember any like that, but they had to be for it to
be alive, I guess, but I don't remember them being on when this happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before Oswald came out you were where we put this A at
the bottom of the ramp, when you had occasion to look off into the garage
area, was it possible to distinguish objects, or distinguish people or cars in
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. There was a car came out the ramp, after we got in line, and
went out the ramp on North Main, up the ramp, out on North Main. We
broke <span class="locked">up&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to ask you this simple question, as you looked out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
over in there, could you see cars or people or anything over behind those TV
cameras; could you see anything beyond those TV cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I saw this car that was coming out. Now, that was
before Lee Oswald was brought down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But did you see that car before it came out of the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I saw it coming out of the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, did you see it before it came to the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. So do you have any recollection as to whether you
could see objects in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir; I don't, I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you watched that car come out of the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Uh huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, where did you watch it go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It went out the Main Street entrance, up the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you see it get to the top of the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I didn't look at it as it entered the top of the ramp. We were
getting back into position, but we did have to break up, because we were all
the way across the ramp, and we had to break up for it to go out, but you
know how you would do, you would back up against the wall or something out
of the way, for it to go by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you say you had to break up. Was there a line formed
across there before the car came out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, we were standing just, you know, side of one another all
the way across there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that Sam Pierce's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. They say it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. They say it was. Do you remember how many people were
in that car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this the last car that came out of the garage before Lee
Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. There was one come out and backed up in position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; but was that the last one that went up the Main Street
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I said there was two cars to start with, and some of them said
there wasn't but one, and I said I guess there was just one, but I thought at
that time I remembered two cars going out, but I am not going to swear that
there were, because I could be wrong about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I know that, but I want to know just what you remember
and whatever your recollection is. Then we will try to see how good it really
is. But what do you think you saw when this car&mdash;you say you think you saw
two cars go up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I think so. That's my honest opinion about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That's what I want. Now, when you saw that first car go
up the ramp, how long would you say after the first car went up did the second
car go up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, it wasn't very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, did you watch that first car go up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as you were standing here where we have marked the A
and as you looked over toward the armored car, did you have occasion to
look over at that armored car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It was straight in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That was up near the top of the Commerce Street ramp,
wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir; or just inside. I don't believe it was all the way under
the shed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Chief Batchelor up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Captain Butler up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Captain Butler?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't remember Captain Butler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Sergeant Dean, did you see him up in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Sergeant Dean. I believe I did. There was a bottle fell out
of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you see the bottle fall out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you actually see the bottle from where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you had occasion to look up the Main Street <span class="locked">ramp&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well now, my back was to the Main Street ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Not the entire time; there were times when you looked up that
ramp too, wasn't there? You were down there for quite awhile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I don't remember just, you know, turning around and looking
back up that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember whether or not there was an officer stationed
up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see him up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Did you know who he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir; he was a regular officer, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, a regular officer patrolman has a green patch on his
shoulder up here. A reserve officer has a white patch; a radio accident investigator
has a red patch. I believe traffic wears a brown. He was a regular
patrolman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you see him before he got up to the top of that ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Did I see him before he got up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. You mean did I see him going up there? Now, I may have seen
him in the basement, before he was sent up there. I don't know about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you have remembered him, though; do you remember
seeing him in the basement before he was sent up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Not that I recall; no sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember seeing him walk up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So from where you were standing, I take it you could see the
green patch on <span class="locked">his&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Coat. And you wear glasses, don't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Not all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you wearing glasses that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir; I use them mostly to read with or some work like this
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is your eyesight without glasses 20-20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir; if they was I wouldn't be wearing glasses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you still tell <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I see off at a distance good, but I can't see to read a newspaper
or something, a fine print or something close to me, but off at a distance&mdash;I
drive without glasses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You and I are sitting here maybe 6 or 8 feet away. Take off
your glasses. Do you have any trouble seeing me [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir; not a bit. Where I have my trouble is fine print and
something like that [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Take your glasses off a second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Okay [complying].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hold up something here, and do you see a colored
spot on there [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I see a red one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And I am holding this dictaphone package, about 10 feet away
from you, aren't I [indicating]?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I would say something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how many red spots do you see on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I only see one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. One big one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or one blurred one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't know what you call a big one. It's about like my little
finger, end of it [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell what sort of shape it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does it look like a triangle or an arrow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It looks like it goes up to a point and comes down to a point and
goes straight across the bottom [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me state for the record that is pretty good for a man
born in 1911. This thing that I am holding up is a red arrow which appears
on the back of a Dictaphone belt holder, and this arrow, the stem part of the
arrow is not more than a quarter of an inch long. The pointed part of the
arrow is unquestionably the most prominent part of it.</p>

<p>I am going to ask you to hold it up and I am going to stand back here and
I will tell you that I have got my glasses on, but I am not corrected at 20-20
vision. If I didn't know how that came up I would have some difficulty telling
what that is [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; I think that's pretty good. So you could see this man's
green patch on <span class="locked">his&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That's right. He was a patrolman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well now, did you ever have occasion to look up that ramp?
How many times did you have occasion to look up that ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, it's like I say, I don't remember just turning around and,
you know, just looking up the ramp, but maybe walking into this place to get
into position or something or other, I was facing that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sort of looking around generally up there; I mean as you walked
around in this area we have marked "A," did you from time to time glance up
in this general direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. From where you marked "A," I couldn't see from there. You
are talking about this "A" here [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; I am talking about this "A" here at the bottom of the ramp
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Oh, yes. I could from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you glance up from time to time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I won't say I did, because I don't remember whether I did or
didn't. More than likely I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now; did you glance back at the TV cameras from time to
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I would say I did; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after this second car moved out, did you have occasion to
glance over at the TV cameras at any time, toward the TV cameras at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I would say, just right offhand, I would say I looked around,
but as far as just watching the TV cameras, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you observe what any other officers were doing in your
area on that side of the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. There was a man to the side of me, to my right, that was in
civilian clothes, and was a news reporter that had a microphone in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he to your right or was he in front of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. He was to my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Directly to your right. Now, where was Officer Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Right in front of me and a little to my left. In other words,
we were standing facing this direction and Officer Harrison was more or less
like this. I was looking over his right shoulder [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were looking over his right shoulder. Were you pressed
right up against him at the time Lee Oswald moved out?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I wouldn't say I was pressed against him. I was directly&mdash;you
know, next to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anybody behind you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to state for the record that we have here a Mr.
Robert Davis with the attorney general's office with the State of Texas, who has
been sitting in on these hearings, and he just walked into the room, and I am
holding up, at about the same distance that I held this thing from Captain
Arnett&mdash;is that right, Captain Arnett [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am holding this about the same distance from Mr. Davis,
and I am asking him if he sees any colored items on the back of this Dictaphone
card that I am holding up [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many colored things do you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Six.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He has got <span class="locked">better&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Five dots and a colored arrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as far as this arrow was concerned, how would you
describe that arrow; can you see the stem on the arrow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. See what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Stem on the arrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; it's fat, kind of heavy, bulky stem on the arrow. Looks
more like a house turned on its side than its does an arrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you got 20-20 vision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. (Nods head.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don't wear glasses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The record should reflect he did a better job than you.</p>

<p>Let me ask you this, Captain Arnett: I am going to ask you to step to the
back of the room over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Back where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Step over to the doorway there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, take your glasses off. You didn't have them on. I am
going to hold up a card here, and can you see the colors on that card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I see green and white [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. See any other colors [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. There is a little lighter up at the top of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell me whether you see any objects on there or
whether you see a circle or a band or something exact or what do you see on
there [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, to that end I see something light running up and down,
in the upper part of it, just a portion of it is a lighter&mdash;kind of a blue color.
Then it's a green, then down closer to your thumb it's white [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, let me state for the record that what I held up was a
Mobil gas credit card, which has in the top half of it a band that has a blue
background on it, and against that blue background there is a picture of a
Mobil gas station, which is white, and some background scenery which runs
behind the Mobil station in some sort of a band, which is green, looks like grass
and trees, and just above the blue field there is a completely white area, and
in that white area there is written the word credit card, and there is a Mobil
gas seal.</p>

<p>I think that is a fair description of what's on this card [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you are now seated close enough to me now that you can
see it with your glasses on [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Davis, do you think that is a fair description of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; I think that is a fair description of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Do you think I got anywhere close to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I understand there was nobody standing behind you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Not that I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anybody directly to your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. To my left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; as you faced the direction that Lee Oswald was coming
from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. There was another reporter with a pencil and pad to my left.
Then I said Captain King and another man beyond him that I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were these people in the same line that Blackie Harrison
was in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir. They were in the line with me. Blackie Harrison was
in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I am going to mark this "Dallas, Tex., Captain Arnett,
3-25-64," and this is Exhibit 5034, and I am going to start another one here.</p>

<p>All right. Now, Captain, I want you to put an "A" on this copy of the map
where you were standing, put an "A" where you were standing when Oswald
came out [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Okay. Now, this is the brick building here. Now, I want to
be sure that I am looking at this right [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Okay. There was a news reporter [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, put an "A" where you were standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, put an H in the circle around it where Blackie
Harrison was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, who was the other officer that you said was to your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. A news reporter and Captain King, and I don't know where
this other one was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Put a "K" where Captain King was standing, and put an "X"
where that newspaper reporter was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was there anybody between Captain King and the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. There was one person, but I couldn't tell you whether he was
in civilian clothes or who they were or anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Put a question mark there. All right. You put
a question there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Got it wrong, didn't I? [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you have changed it. You put a dot to your right where
there was a newsman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Uh-huh [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this the man that had the microphone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anybody in front of that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes. They were lined up down this wall here. I don't know
whether there was anybody standing directly in front of him. I wouldn't say
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anybody directly to Blackie Harrison's left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I would say they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don't remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you happen to remember these people that you put
on the chart here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, standing there with them, <span class="locked">well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see photographs, did you see movies of this after
Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I have seen them; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That didn't have any bearing on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you able to see yourself in those movies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I am in some magazines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were able to see yourself in the magazines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, Sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And is that how you were able to <span class="locked">distinguish&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Those people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Huh, uh. This letter that was written the 27th was before
I ever saw any films or magazines, either one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do the magazine shots which you have seen, in which
you have seen yourself, do they show the man to your left, who you thought
was a newsman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do they show Captain King?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How is it that just you come through on these magazine shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I don't know how they come through, but the Dallas
Morning News and the Times Herald that had the big complete picture, all the
front page was completely covered, I am not in it. Now, this newsman that
was on my right, it shows the microphone but it doesn't show me at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What magazine did you see yourself in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Four Dark Days in History, Four Days, Kennedy From Childhood
to&mdash;I don't remember just exactly what it did say on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you happen to remember in Four Dark Days, what page
your picture was on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir. But if you got one I can show it to you, but it's not
before the shooting, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Oh, this is the shot that's taken after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Shows me scuffling <span class="locked">with&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you haven't seen a picture of yourself standing there in
that line, have you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, where did you see that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. In Four Days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In Four Days you saw that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir. And it didn't show anybody standing beside me, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does it show Blackie Harrison in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I believe it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, there is only one picture of you in Four Days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. In Four Days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No. There is three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Three pictures of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are they all on the same page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't remember for sure whether they are on the same page
or not, but they are in the same connection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. They are all in connection with the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Do you want me to tell you what they are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. One of them shows me standing like I told you. The next one
shows me in the scuffle with Jack Ruby from here up, doesn't show any other
part (indicating).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Just shows the top of your head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. From right here up. The next one shows the top of my cap,
from my back, following Oswald out to the ambulance. That's it [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. There is only one that shows you standing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That's the only one I have seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does it show anything but your face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. From about right here up [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About the middle of your chest up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Something like that. One in Four Days in History shows me
standing looking down like this, and L.&nbsp;C. Graves is wrestling with the gun,
before I took hold of Ruby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, did you see Ruby move forward out of the
crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Not out of the crowd. He was in front of me before I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see him move in front of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I can give you an illustration better than I can tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Illustrate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Okay. I was standing like this, facing this way (indicating).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, let's put Mr. Davis up in front of you, about
where Blackie Harrison was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You place him up there. And Oswald is going to be to your right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I was looking over his shoulder [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. The first <span class="locked">thing&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were about that far away from him [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were about 4 inches away from Blackie Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I would say something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And looking over his right shoulder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That's right. Lee Oswald came out&mdash;&mdash;[indicating]&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are looking to your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. To my right. Lee Oswald came out, the two detectives, Leavelle
and Graves, Leavelle was handcuffed to Oswald. Graves was on the left side
of him, had him by the arm. The first time I saw Jack Ruby he was just about
in this position, just pow, that's just how quick it happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you get back there in the position where you first saw
Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No. You get where you saw Jack [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that about how far Jack was <span class="locked">from&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. From Oswald when I saw him, I guess [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that how far he was from Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. He might have been a little further out this way from him, but
(indicating).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, the first time you saw Ruby, Ruby was standing
forward, he was standing between&mdash;in front of Harrison in the direction
of the Commerce Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But he was off to Harrison's left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. He was to Harrison's left a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What direction was Ruby facing when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Just as you and I [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Facing almost directly at Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. In this position [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you see anybody standing behind his back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Did I see anybody behind Ruby's back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, who would have been directly&mdash;as you are
standing, directly toward Ruby's right, which would be up the Main Street
ramp, who would have been standing right in that position along the row that
you were in, directly to Ruby's right, toward the Main Street ramp [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I named this newsman with a pad, I mean, I said&mdash;I didn't
know his name. I said he was to my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes; left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, that man was to your left. Was Ruby right
in front of him or was he right in front of Captain King?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, he was just to the left of Blackie Harrison. Now, whether
he was out in front in this manner right in front of King, I wouldn't say for
certain [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you able to state whether Ruby was a different man from
the man you saw next to you holding the pad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, yes; I would say he was a different man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How are you able to state that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I don't believe the newsman was dressed like Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But did you see that newsman again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Did I see him again; is that the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. After the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I couldn't say whether I did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How would you describe the dress of that newsman; did he
have on a hat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he wear glasses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have a suit on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I thought he had a kind of raincoat, jacket on, something of
that type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you see that man around before Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I had been in this position, I said 15 minutes, and so far
as I know Blackie Harrison had been standing in front of me all that time, and
this man beside me, I believe, had been there all this time. I believe they had
all been there all this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, about 1 minute before Oswald was shot there was a car
that drove up and split the lines up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That's right. I don't know whether it was 1 minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But shortly before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Shortly before there was; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that man standing over next to you before the car went
up the ramp; was that man in the raincoat next to you before the car went up
the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you sure of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I think he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What makes you think he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I think I remember him being there with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you talked to Captain King about this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how long did you remain in the police building after the
shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. After the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Whenever he shot Oswald, I made a dive for him, and L.&nbsp;C. Graves,
the detective, had him, and he had him like this, had the gun like this, and they
were scuffling. I got him by the leg. I don't know what leg I got him by, but
I got him by the leg, and I would say there were seven or eight of us had ahold
of him. We carried him back into the jail office, and while we had him down,
handcuffed, he said, "I am Jack Ruby. All of you know me." They had him
handcuffed by that time. I turned him loose and walked back over here where
Oswald was laying [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, let me ask you this: how long were you in the
building the rest of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I believe I went home about 1:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, by the time you went home had you heard any rumors
about how Ruby got down into that basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't believe so. I have heard rumors since then, but I didn't
that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let the record reflect that Mr. Davis has left the room, and I
hope the record reflects that we had a short break, a very short break, about 2
minutes, and we are back and ready to go. Would you read the last part back?</p>

<p>(The record was here read by the reporter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark for identification, Dallas, Tex., Captain Arnett,
3-25-64, Exhibit 5035, and I am going to hand this to you. I am going to ask
you, Captain Arnett, if what I am showing you is the dictaphone belt case with
the red arrow on it that you identified earlier in the testimony [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Do you want me to initial it [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is the side which I have got the identification on the side
that I showed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It was up like this. Yes [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I mean the side [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, would you sign that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Just sign it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir. Okay. Now, I am also going to mark for identification,
Dallas, Tex., Captain Arnett, 3-25-64, Exhibit 5036.</p>

<p>Now, this is the diagram of the basement on which you placed markings indicating
where you and Harrison and King and the reporter were standing,
[indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Just before Oswald came out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. [Nods head.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, just before Oswald came out, did you see a man right
next to Blackie Harrison's left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. To his left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. As he would face up Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As Blackie would face Commerce Street, did you see a man to
his left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well now, there were men out, you know, on the camera and
stuff, to his left, if that's what you are talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see anybody standing to his left, other than men
manning the cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I wouldn't say for certain that I did, because he may have
been the last one in that row, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, he was in the front row, wasn't he; Blackie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. He was in front of me; yes. And I would say he was in the
front row, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there a solid line of people between Blackie and the TV
cameras, in the row that Blackie was standing in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It seems to me like there was somebody by the side of Blackie,
but I am not going to say that there were because the first time I saw Jack
Ruby he was to his left, coming up. Now, whether there was somebody right
beside of Blackie Harrison, I am not going to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The first time you saw Jack he was sort of hunched over with
the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. He was hunched over. He was in this position, and whenever
he shot him he went down like that [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Ruby when he was moving toward Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I saw him moving from where I told you, up to Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see Ruby standing still?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall whether there was a solid line of people or
how that line of people was from Blackie Harrison on to the TV cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, like I said, I think there was somebody the other side of
him, but I am not going to be certain about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, were there any other police officers up in the same row
that Blackie Harrison was in?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. They were people lined up all the way up the wall and on this
wall over here, they were lined all the way up to the edge of it [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this, Captain Arnett, did you receive instructions
before Oswald came out as to where these newspaper people were to stand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Where the newspaper&mdash;no; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you present when some men convened around Officer Jones,
Captain Jones, prior to Oswald's coming down, when Jones gave some instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Sergeant Jones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No. Captain Jones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Captain Jones. I remember seeing Captain Jones there, but I
don't remember any group being around him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, did you have any instructions to the effect that you were not
to permit newspaper people to be over here on the Main Street side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any instructions that you were to try to keep
these newspaper people over toward the entrance of the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, what instructions did you have as to what you were to
do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, the main instructions I had was to&mdash;when we was placing
these men around, searching the building, see that there was nobody in there
at all, other than was supposed to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But that was an hour before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, you knew Oswald was going to come out that
door from the jail, jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you have some idea that you were supposed to keep
the area free?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, wasn't supposed to let anybody in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, if newspaper people had crowded up in front of him,
did you have any instructions as to what you were to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, do you know if any of the other people had instructions
like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you write the report that has been marked as Exhibit
5033?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. When did I write it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. That one was&mdash;let me see, now. That happened on Sunday, I
went to Tippit's funeral on Monday, I went to Corpus Christi on Monday night,
I was in Corpus on Tuesday. I believe I wrote that on Wednesday [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Right. Now, Sunday was the <span class="locked">24th&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Monday would have been the 25th, Tuesday the 26th, be the
27th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Would you indicate on here, would you put composed
November 27, and initial that [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. How do you spell composed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. [Spelling] C-o-m-p-o-s-e-d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. [Spelling] <span class="locked">C-o-m-p&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. [Spelling]&mdash;o-s-e-d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. November 27?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir. Okay. Now, in between this time, in between the time
that you left the police building on the 24th and the time you prepared this
statement, did you talk with any of the members of the police department
about the events?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. You mean how it was&mdash;how they were set up or something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No. Any conversations&mdash;did you talk with any of the police
officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well now, on Monday, after this on Sunday, I was down there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
and called some men to meet me out at the Baptist Church on Beckley, to work
traffic for the Tippit funeral. I talked to Lieutenant Pierce. He asked me
if I would get some reserves out there to help, that they was going to need some,
and I said I will call and get some and go out there myself, and I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with Pierce about the things that had happened
on November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Not that I know of now. Not that I remember about. We were
talking about this one particular area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you ever talk with Pierce at that time, prior to the
time you wrote this statement, did you ever talk with Pierce about how Ruby
got into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't know whether I did prior to that letter or not. I have
heard since then that when Lieutenant Pierce drove out, that the officers stepped
out to stop the traffic and that Jack Ruby said that's when he walked in. Now,
when I heard that I couldn't say, the date, but I don't know, but I have heard
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before you prepared the statement, did you talk with any
of the reserves or any members of the police department, about how Ruby might
have got down in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, it seems that maybe some people would say, well, he must
have come in with a camera or something, you know, like that. As far as just
individuals talking to anybody about it, I don't remember, you know, just particularly
talking about that one thing of how he got in there. But I am confident
that he wasn't in there. I am confident of that, as I am that Jack Ruby
shot Oswald, and I saw that. I may be wrong about it, but now, that's just the
way I feel about it, that he wasn't in that basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you think he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I don't know where he was. But as far as him being in
there any length of time, I just don't believe he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you have seen him if he came across the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Would I have seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, it seems like I would have, but I don't know that I
would have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why do you think you would have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, you know, if you are just looking off, like this, and something
happens over here in 10 or 12 feet of you, you will <span class="locked">almost&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Wasn't your attention focused almost all the time&mdash;after
Pierce's car went up the ramp, wasn't your attention focused towards the
jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I would say yes, most of the time, but you can just let anything&mdash;you
can be driving down the road and a bird or something fly by, you
will get a glance of it, and I believe if he had come over that rail I would have
got the glance off of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you see things happening over by that railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, I am not going to say that you could or you couldn't, but
I believe if he had come over that railing, I believe I would have saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well now, if he had come over the railing behind the line that you
were standing in you wouldn't have seen him, would you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No. Sure wouldn't have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. If you were drawing a straight line across your
shoulders&mdash;well, let's not do it that way. You have got this thing marked on
the map here where the A is and where I placed the TV cameras. If you were
drawing a straight line across the Main Street ramp, where would that line&mdash;how
far would that line have come from the TV cameras that I have placed here
[indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. How far would it come?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. In other words, how far up the [indicating]&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I would say a straight line behind the cameras would have been
about like Mr. Davis from me [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am asking you here, I am asking you to tell me about how
far up the Main Street ramp you were standing from the TV cameras; would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
you say that the TV cameras and you were the same distance up the Main Street
ramp or they were a little bit in front of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. They were a little in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much; by a little bit, would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Well, 5 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Maybe 5 feet in front of you. Could they have been less than
5 feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't believe they would have been. They could have. I am
just roughly guessing now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were there people congregated around those TV cameras,
in front of those TV cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. In front of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't remember any of them being in front of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about along the sides of the TV cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. If I remember right, there was a man at each one of the cameras,
operating it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But there weren't other people crowded down around them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Not that I remember; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well now, wouldn't Captain King and that newspaperman have
blocked your side vision over in the direction of the TV cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. It could have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If Jack Ruby had walked down that Main Street ramp would
you have seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Not without turning around and looking back, I wouldn't have;
no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any occasion to turn back and look around after
Rio Pierce's car went up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you mean you don't remember <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't remember looking around, no sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anybody suggest to you before you wrote this statement that
you should have seen Ruby in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anybody ask you if you did see Ruby in there before you
wrote this statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Other than I just said, I saw him just like I have told you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who asked you to write this statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Captain Solomon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did Captain Solomon ever ask you before you wrote the
statement whether you saw Ruby in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I don't recall that he did. But I told him just like I told you,
the first time I saw him, where he was, the position he was, so there would be
no cause for him to ask me that, because I am telling you the truth about where
he was when I saw him. He was too close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, do you <span class="locked">feel&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Whenever I had ahold of him, I felt like there could be some more
shots fired. I believe you would have felt the same way, because I wasn't figuring
on that first one being fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. I am going to ask you to sign all these things [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. All right [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I ask you to sign them, and I assume that when you sign them
you are indicating that you think they are accurate and wouldn't make any
changes to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Yes, sir. I have tried to tell you just as near the truth as I can.
Just sign it <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Just sign it and put the date. Now, will you sign that one and
this one here [indicating]?</p>

<p>Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have I interviewed you before the beginning of this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Before tonight?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Has any other member of the staff interviewed you before I took
your deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. The only one that interviewed me was the FBI men, came to my
home, one of them was from Memphis, Tenn., and I don't know where the other
one came from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don't have to ask you this, but we say it for the record
anyhow. If anything should come to your attention which you think would be
helpful to us or which you find maybe you want to make a correction in anything
that you have told us, will you come to us <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And advise us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnett</span>. I am for you 100 percent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I certainly appreciate your assistance. That's all.</p>

<h2 id="BLB">TESTIMONY OF BUFORD LEE BEATY</h2>

<p>The testimony of Buford Lee Beaty was taken at 9 a.m., on March 26, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. For the record, I am Burt Griffin, and I am a member of the
advisory staff of the general counsel's office for the President's Commission
on the Assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>This Commission has been appointed pursuant to Executive Order of President
Johnson issued on November 29, 1963, and pursuant to a joint resolution
of Congress No. 137.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the Resolution and Executive order, the Commission
has authority to establish rules and procedure which they have done, and pursuant
to those rules and procedures I have been designated to come here to
Dallas to take your sworn deposition.</p>

<p>You are appearing here by virtue of a letter which was sent from the general
counsel of the Commission, Mr. J. Lee Rankin, to Chief Curry.</p>

<p>Actually, you are entitled to receive a 3-day written notice. However, under
the rules of the Commission, if you want to, you can waive the notice, and we
can go forward without the actual letter, I will ask you a little later whether
you want a letter, or waive it.</p>

<p>The scope of this investigation is that we are directed to investigate and
evaluate and report back to President Johnson all the facts that surround the
assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent murder of Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>Our particular concern in calling you is in connection with the death of
Lee Oswald, although I am going to ask you some questions that will develop
a little background that people who are working on the assassination of the
President can use to decide whether you were in a position to provide some physical
action that something might have happened in which they are particularly
concerned about and as to which they need more witnesses.</p>

<p>But our primary concern in talking to you is to find out the matters which
might be relevant to Ruby, although we are interested in anything else that
you might know of your own knowledge that is valuable to the Commission.</p>

<p>Let me ask you first of all, would you like us to get you a written letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He is shaking his head no. I might say, she has to take your
answer down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I am sorry; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, also, you are entitled to an attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. What do I need an attorney for?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Some of the people come with attorneys. I don't want you to
feel that maybe if you come with an attorney that you are prejudiced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I don't need an attorney, I don't think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to
tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you state your name for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Buford Lee Beaty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live, Mr. Beaty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. 404 Freeman, Garland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. July 10, 1924.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Police department, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Fifteen and a half years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you in any particular bureau of the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Narcotics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Altogether, about 4 years. This last time, about 6 months, something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the earlier period that you were with the narcotics
bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. From 1957 to 1960. And then I came back this time in June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now from 1960 until you came back, what bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Burglary and theft.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you hold a particular rank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Detective; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you know Ruby announced that you would recognize
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you tell us how you happened to first become familiar
with Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. When I first met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Well, I wrote him a traffic ticket one time about 1951, or something
like that. But I knew of him before then.</p>

<p>He had a joint down on South Ervay, and he was always calling the police
to pick up drunks and one thing and another. Everybody knows Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was the Silver Spur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In connection with your duties in the narcotics bureau, did
you ever have occasion to talk with him or conduct any investigation in connection
with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. About narcotics specifically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, in connection with any of your duties, investigating duties
with the police department, as opposed to traffic tickets? Let me ask you that
question generally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Not that I ever recall. I can't think of anything specifically at
all where I could say I had occasion to interrogate him about anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am getting at is, was Jack Ruby ever treated by you
as a person whom you might go to if you needed to find out about somebody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. A confidant? No, sir; absolutely not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whether other people you worked with in the
narcotics bureau might have attempted to use him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you familiar with any narcotics investigation that ever
took place with respect to Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now how often would you say that you saw Ruby during the
last 3 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Possibly, four, maybe five times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were the occasions for seeing Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Well, I saw him one time. I was working late nights and I saw
him walking his dog after his joint closed down on Commerce Street, and I
run into him on the street, and I go by his joint. You don't say hello and look
around. You say hello.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever stop in and visit you while you were in your
office at the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes; that was the last time I saw him before the shooting.
He came by&mdash;didn't particularly come to see me, but he just came to the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall about when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No; it seemed like it was about a month before all this happened,
something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he speak to anybody in the narcotics office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes; he talked to myself, and I believe Lieutenant Cornwall
was in and out of the office, and Dan Asabell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what you all talked with Jack about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes; he talked about a girl. He had a stripper down there.
Let me think if I remember what her name was. Jada from New Orleans.</p>

<p>The whole thing was how he thought Jada was just a little indecent about her
act and he would have to turn the lights off every once in a while and tell her
to clean it up a little bit, and one thing and another. And how they went
through a little "Hazel" in Judge Richburg's court over all this. It was all in the
papers, the whole story was and that is about the gist of what we talked about.
And Jada testified at the previous thing.</p>

<p>The bureau I work in, the special bureau, also handles all the dancehall
licenses and the liquor licenses and it could be that, I don't believe he made a
special trip to our office, I think he came to the bureau and might have had a
little business for a liquor license, or something, I don't know. I didn't ask him
about it at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, the narcotics bureau, is that correct to call it a bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Narcotics section is a subdivision of the special service bureau,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Within the special service bureau, there is a department which
handles dancehall policemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, does everybody who is a part of the special service bureau
occupy the same suite of offices?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does the narcotics bureau occupy the same suite of offices as
the dancehall bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What other people occupy the same suite of offices?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Vice squad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember, Detective Beaty, that you were on duty on
November 22, the day the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where you were when you first heard he had been
shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Trade Mart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you go from the Trade Mart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Went back to our office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I think until about 9 o'clock that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you on duty on the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you remain in the police department all day on the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes, sir. What day was the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That was Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Directing your attention to Friday, did you see Jack Ruby in the
hallway at all on Friday, or any place in the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now on Saturday, did you see Jack Ruby any time on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time would you estimate that you left the police department
on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Worked a lot of overtime. I am trying to remember. It was
probably 6:30 or 7 o'clock that night; Saturday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now do you recall whether when you left the police department
that night you had heard any rumors or had received any kind of information
that would indicate that Oswald was going to be moved from the city jail to the
county jail on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Sunday a regular day for you to report to duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time did you report for duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Eight o'clock that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember where you parked your car that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. In the basement, I believe. No; that is not right. It is Sunday
you are talking about now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I couldn't tell you to save my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At anytime on Sunday did you ever have occasion to come
in the Commerce Street, come down the steps from Commerce Street and
walk down the hallway in the basement that leads to the records room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. The pedestrian entrance to the city hall basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I don't remember that either. If I park my car on Commerce
Street around there somewhere, I probably did. If I parked it on Main, I
probably took that other entrance, but I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you don't remember, that is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I couldn't tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you arrived for duty, did you report up to the
narcotics bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that on the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No; on the second floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain in the narcotics bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Until about 9:15 or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then what did you do at 9:15?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Everyone decided we wanted to get some coffee, and as we
got off the elevator in the basement, I noticed all the newspaper people standing
out there and a couple of reserve officers and a policeman, I think, whose
name was Nelson. I didn't know him at the time. He was guarding the
entrance. And just curiosity made me, instead of going to get coffee, stay
around to see what was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were the people that you were going to go to coffee with in
the narcotics bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No; vice and narcotics, and some administrative section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any people from the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know where they went after coffee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they go out of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes; out of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, tell me what happened when you saw this fellow Nielson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Right away, nothing. I mean I just happened to glance over
here and here's two officers, and nothing happened. I just kind of lingered
behind and I didn't care for coffee anyway, and I told them I would wait
for them, and I kind of figured they would maybe move Oswald, and I just
wanted to see him and that is what it amounted to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you&mdash;you expected that Oswald would be moved fairly
soon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you received some word before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Everybody in the world, at 10 o'clock. They said in the newspaper
and radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. By this time when the boys in your group went out for coffee,
had there been any instructions to standby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you later receive some instructions to standby to help
in the Oswald move?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. As Capt. O.&nbsp;A. Jones got off the elevator, and as he walked by,
he said, "Come here, I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did this take place in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Right by the elevator door to the basement. He said there will
be some officers come down from the third floor, and told me to wait for them
right here, and he indicated close by the entrance to the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now Detective Beaty, what is your best estimate of how long
this encounter with Jones was before Oswald actually came downstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. What time did he get shot? It was about probably 30 minutes
before he actually came down and Ruby shot him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the important thing. I would rather have you fix
it in terms of that time rather than some specific time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Around 30 minutes or something like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Because I noticed in the interview which you gave to the FBI,
you indicated that this was about 10 o'clock that you saw Jones. Did you
have any idea at the time when you gave this interview to Agents Dallman
and Quigley&mdash;that was on December 3&mdash;did you have anything specific in
mind when you told them that it was 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I just was trying to remember when Captain Jones told me
to remain there. No; I was just trying to remember about the lapse of time,
it seemed to me like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you to look over this with me. Let me point out,
you indicated here that you thought Oswald came down about 11:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, they have reported that you told them that it was 10 o'clock.
Now it may be that that was that time it could be a mistake on their part writing
it down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Well, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Boy, it is hard to remember, but it seems to me like he breezed
through in just probably about 30 minutes&mdash;could possibly be longer&mdash;after Mr.
Jones told me this. I waited around for probably another 4 or 5 minutes and
the elevator doors opened up, and here all the officers from the third floor,
and we moved from there out into the middle hallway. And they describe it
here as a, whatever, I don't know, right outside the jail office door, the little
hall where they brought him out of the jail office door there, and we remained
there for about 30 minutes. And if the shooting actually occurred around 11:30,
I have made an error about the original time Captain Jones said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you want to take my pen and on this statement would
you want to put a circle around the 10 o'clock and make some note out on the
side that what you meant was 30 minutes before the shooting, or whatever you
think was the accurate time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Gosh, I don't remember. I just can't remember to save my life
what time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How is your memory as to the fact that it was about 30 minutes
before the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Thirty minutes, may be an hour. That times passes so fast along
in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you think it could have been longer than an hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I don't think so; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would it be fair to say, and I want you to be very frank about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
this, because I don't want to change this in any way that isn't fair, would it be
fair to change this time 10 a.m., to <span class="locked">read&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. That it was 10 or 10:30, would that be all right, because I don't
remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To read a half hour or&mdash;to an hour before Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Well, I don't carry a watch so I never know what time it is unless
I ask somebody and it would be a matter of kind of remembering, and if you
want to say 10 or 10:30, that would be about the same time, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would it be just fair to say, "I am not certain about the exact
time?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. That would be fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wish you would do this in your own handwriting and write in
there, "I am not certain about the time."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. [Makes statement and initials.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Put a date after your initials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. 3-26-64. I don't even remember what month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, now, do you recall any of the people who came down
in the contingent with Captain Jones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. They are listed on the back of that, the best I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have listed on page 32, of what we have labeled Commission
Document 85 (Beaty Exhibit 5040), the names of about a dozen police officers.
Did you see all these people come down together, or these people that you
remember as having been in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. They came&mdash;let me read them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me read them for the record. B.&nbsp;H. Combest. J.&nbsp;H.
Hutchinson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Those two, boy, they are supposed both special service officers, too,
and I don't know how in the world they could have received word unless they
called and told them to come down, because they were the only ones from the
special service bureau down there with me at the time. I can't remember them
getting off the elevator at the time, but Captain <span class="locked">Martin&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me read them. W.&nbsp;J. Harrison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes; I remember him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Wilbur Jay Cutchshaw. James Watson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. L.&nbsp;D. Miller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. R.&nbsp;L. Lowery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes; he was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. J. Charles Goolsby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. W.&nbsp;E. Chambers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Captain Frank Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Lieutenant W. Wiggins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No; he wasn't. He was a jail supervisor. He was already down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. R.&nbsp;C. Wagner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the complete list.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. They must have been on two elevators.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, have these men that you saw come down, Harrison, Cutchshaw,
Watson, Miller, Lowery, Goolsby, Chambers, and Martin, were all those
people attached to the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No; Chambers is forgery. Goolsby is juvenile. Lowery is juvenile.
Wagner, I believe, is forgery. Watson is auto theft. Harrison is
juvenile. I don't know where Miller works.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Cutchshaw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Cutchshaw is juvenile. Hutchinson and Combest are both special
services.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But Wagner was not in the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes; he was with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He came down in the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes; Wiggins wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Wiggins wasn't in the elevator. Now, when these men got off
the elevator, what did they do? Where did they go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Walked straight out there in front of the elevator to the windows
by&mdash;are you familiar with that place down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. What I call it, where you go through that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Might as well call it the window in front of the jail office, if
that is where it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to sketch a diagram of the basement. Did they go
through the swinging doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. We waited right about here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are indicating just about at the first window of the jail
office as you come from the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The elevator we are talking about is the general elevator that
services all floors and is available to anybody that comes into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. We are not talking about the jail elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you all congregated outside that window, what took
place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Within 5 or 10 minutes, Captain Jones came through and spoke to
me, and we walked through the small hall by the jail office window into the
double doors and he instructed us to stand on either side of that hallway, which
would be just outside the double doors as you enter into the basement parking
area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, Mr. Beaty, I am going to hand you my pen. I am going
to ask you if you will mark on this diagram where was your understanding that
people were to place themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Where they were assigned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; what assignments did Jones make at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. He said, "Divide yourself up about half and half. Half on this
side and half on this side."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you have drawn a line on either side, straight line on
either side of the hallway that leads out between the swinging doors and the
Main Street and Commerce Street ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell officers to stand any place except along those two
walls where you have drawn the line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir. He instructed us to, when they brought Oswald out of
the smaller swinging door in the outside hall, to make a path for him and be
sure that nobody got to him or slowed him down. In other words, indicating
that&mdash;I don't remember whether he said to get to him or not. He just said keep
the people back so we can get him through, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this: What was your understanding that you
people were to do, if anything, when Oswald got abreast of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. To keep the people back. Of course, over here where I was, there
was nobody behind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you place on the chart where it was you were stationed?
Put an "X" there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. [Complies.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you again. As Oswald moved out of the jail office
and approached the car that he was to get in, did you have any understanding
as to any action that you were supposed to take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Like I said before, of course, there was nobody at that time, we
thought, but the press and police officers down there, and at that time we were,
television cameras were set up across the ramp behind a railing about 4 foot
tall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you place the TV cameras?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Somewhere right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you to put the TV cameras in a square.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. [Complies.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were there only two TV cameras in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. The best I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if there was a TV camera in the garage entranceway
to the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir; I sure don't. There were so many of them, and guys had
them on their shoulders, and little tape recorders, and one thing all over the
joint.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I am talking only about TV cameras, the big things that
set on a tripod as opposed to little movie cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. They had some of the shoulder cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wasn't thinking of them. I am just talking about the stationary
cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I suppose I didn't pay any attention to them at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am only talking now about the instructions that you remember
that came from Captain Jones. Do you have any idea as to what you were to
do when Oswald got abreast of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes, sir. He told us we would keep this aisle clear, and at this
time the cameras were run in and out of this door and something through this
door, and around here, and then he returned in about 3 or 4 minutes later and
said, "All you people from the press move back into the driveway." And I will
indicate it by a dotted line across here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. And over into the driveway entrance of the parking area from
the Commerce Street, Main Street ramp. Would you want a dotted line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Let me ask you a question about that. What is your best
estimate of the number of people that were over in the garage entrance area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Counting the people here behind the camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; not counting the people behind the camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Right along in here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; along the dotted line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Thirty-five or forty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that congested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No; it wasn't. You can get that many people in. It is a pretty
wide area. Looks like it might be 50 feet across there, if this is 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, across that 50-foot area, was there just a single line across
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. They could be doubled or tripled. They were all scattered out, of
course. But there seemed like there was some congestion right around there
and behind the cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you draw a half circle in the area or quarter circle in the
area where the congestion was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Right along in here, best I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did there appear to be people standing behind the TV
cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there people standing up above the TV cameras, if you
recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I don't know what they would stand on. There is nothing for
them to stand on unless they had a box or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how did the congestion in this area that you have indicated
by a half circle which runs from about the position of the TV camera
close to the Main Street side, to about the middle of the entrance to the garage,
how did the congestion in that area compare to the congestion along the Main
Street ramp or across the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. The best I remember, most of the people that moved out of this
area moved into this area here. Then they moved over here. It looked like
there might have been as many here, or more, as there were over here. There
must have been a hundred all together all scattered out all in the basement,
and they wouldn't stay still. They would mill around as long as they didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
get past this line here, and we weren't too concerned with them, because they
had uniform officers out here in the basement and they brought those down
earlier and shook down all the cars a time or two, and I don't know what was
going on out here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how many uniformed officers did you see stationed back
here in the basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Earlier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; at the time Oswald came out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I didn't see any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it possible that there might not have been officers there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No; there were some earlier, about 50.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About 50 in there? Did you see them search the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they search the basement, can you remember, before or after
you got the instructions from Captain Jones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I couldn't remember. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you down in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. What do you call the basement now, this or this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am talking about the whole bottom area, all the way from the
elevators that come down from the upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. After the instructions, because I wouldn't be out here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you, prior to the time that your friends planned to go out for
coffee, down in the basement at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you were down in the basement at the time the search of
the basement was conducted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. This was a good hour and a half or something like that, later
on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The basement was searched substantially after you got down
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes. And I understand that this was the second time it happened.</p>

<p>In other words, well, I heard somebody say we have swept the basement out
twice already and I don't remember who said this. This is to indicate that
they searched the cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who was in charge of the search that you saw
take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I would assume that since it was uniformed officers, it would be
Captain Talbert, because they were all uniform officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember whether or not Sergeant Dean was in charge
of that search?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No; Sergeant Dean was there and so was Sergeant Putnam, and
I don't think you could say one was in charge or the other one was in charge.
It was a joint operation. I would say Captain Talbert was in charge. And,
actually, he wasn't down there. He would drop by and leave a few instructions,
some for Dean and some for Putnam and the like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. During the period that you were down in the basement, did
you see cars going in and out, coming up and down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Saw one leave, it was a squad car, and it left and went this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Up the Main Street ramp. Did you see any other cars coming
in the basement? Were officers coming in on routine duty and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I am sure there were, but I don't remember whether they were
or not. I know that they closed it from 9 o'clock on, but I can't remember
exactly what time they shut it off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you first walked out in here in front of the swinging
doors toward the ramp, do you recall if the TV lights were on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir; they weren't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall when the armored car came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if the TV lights were on at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir; I am quite sure that they took some picture of it, but
I don't remember whether, and there again which lights are you talking about?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Man, they were everywhere down there. And the armored car backed down this
ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Commerce Street ramp. And there were people with cameras
on the Main Street ramp back over here, back behind this 55-foot entrance to
the garage. They were everywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there some sort of floodlights set up in connection with
the TV cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I am sure there were. They were awful bright. I don't know
whether they were hooked onto the cameras or something. They brought in
this material, but the best I remember, there was a bunch of them over in
this area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Behind the camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Well, not necessarily. They could have been under or over.
You couldn't hardly tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at the time that the armored car came down the ramp,
did you see what happened around that armored car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Like what now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see anything that happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You saw the armored car come down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. It took them quite a while to get the armored car down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you actually see it come down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Not the whole time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you looked up toward that armored car, were you able
to see people around that armored car from where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Well, tell me when you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At anytime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. It took it about 5 minutes to back down, because it was too
tight for the ramp, and they didn't get it all the way in there. They were
very, very cautious and careful, and it parked up the ramp, and I don't remember
seeing anybody around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall Chief Batchelor coming down into the basement
and going up to the armored car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall any police officers up in the area of the armored
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall whether there was an officer&mdash;did you see
an officer stationed up at the top of the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir; I couldn't see that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that because of the police that were stationed that you
didn't have a straight view of the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as you looked over in this direction over here, could you
see any police officers over in there? The place that I am indicating is in
the direction of the Main Street ramp. Did you see any police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes, sir; some of those officers I mentioned, I don't remember
exactly how they were stationed, which ones. The plainclothes officers were
standing on this side here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you tell us&mdash;I am not asking you who you subsequently
learned was over there, but who you actually remember seeing in that line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I don't know. I couldn't tell you. The only reason I could
on this report I made, I remember who all was down there. That I could
remember. And I remember one was on our side, and I assumed the others
were on the other side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as you look over here toward the TV <span class="locked">cameras&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I am not looking over there much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If, when you did on occasions look over there, could you see
people around the TV cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any trouble distinguishing their faces?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. After the lights were on, you couldn't see nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After the lights were on, you couldn't see anything over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall whether or not Captain Jones instructed
the men that when Oswald was brought out from the jail office to where you
men were standing, that you were supposed to begin to start walking alongside of
Oswald toward the armored car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. He told us to keep the path open, and then he changed this
detail here and pushed them all back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If all of the members of the press were along the Main Street
ramp and were over behind, roughly behind the railing, or at least behind
the TV camera in the direction of the garage area, what function did you
people who were stationed along where you have marked your "X," that wall
that you have your "X," and up the Commerce Street ramp, what function
were you people going to have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I couldn't tell you. I couldn't tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You certainly didn't expect that you were going to have any
trouble from newspaper people, because you were all backed up against the
wall, weren't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I couldn't tell you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, before Ruby shot Oswald, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before Ruby shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. When we first, it occurred to me at the time that&mdash;you don't
have policemen for 15 years, you don't have to sit down and draw them a
diagram to have them cover somebody, and Captain Jones said make the way
open, and it occurred to me that if we had to move around that corner, fine.
At that time there were people all around here and out in the driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time Captain Jones set you up, there had been people
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes; there had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You then displaced news people, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No; whenever Captain Jones come back down, and I think he
had Sergeant Putnam or Dean, and he instructed them all to get back there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The area you are pointing to is on the opposite side from where
you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. If you go on with your interview, I can tell you what my
opinion is why we was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is what I want you to tell me, what your opinion was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Well, of course, the people from the press, they brought Oswald
out here, they all, Captain Jones asked them to please don't ask him no
questions, and let's get this over with as fast as we can. Those are not his
exact words, but that is what he meant. So, we all moved back behind this
line, and as they brought Oswald out to just about the entrance to the Commerce
Street and Main Street ramp right along <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Put a circle where Oswald was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. The three of them were there along here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. I have written "Oswald."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. And, by the way, after that they moved these people back, these
officers on the north side of the hallway were moved out into the ramp area here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. These started to move out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes, sir; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how about the people on your side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. There was only about four of us over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You people stayed where you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this. Do you think these people who were
on the ramp side, which you call the north <span class="locked">side&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes, sir; I would call it the north side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What you have called the north side opposite where you were
standing, do you think those people began to move out sort of instinctively?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No; they moved out before he got out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. And I am sure that there were some more officers that, I don't
know, that were along here. They had two people stationed out here, a reserve
and <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Put an "X" where these reserves were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. To keep these people from coming through here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This was between the swinging doors and the main elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, were there two reserve officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No; they had one reserve and one officer stationed here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes, and before they brought Oswald out, there was some photographers
in this area inside the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have placed circles in the jail office where there were
photographers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. And they were removed by a uniformed officer and asked to come
out here, or out here, or back here, and I recall some of them went this way
and went on out and took their place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Some of them went toward the garage area and some on the
Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Some came back through these double doors, and were standing
along this hallway like they might be going to try to photograph through the
window. I remember one guy had a big shoulder camera and one at&mdash;at one
of these windows here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, is it fair to say that one of the functions you people served
in standing along the wall that you were on, was to make sure that as these
photographers cleared out the jail office, they didn't line up along the wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes; also, to double check this double door after he went by,
and somebody might have gotten instructions, I don't remember whether they
did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, detective, after Oswald was shot, did you go into the jail
office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go upstairs with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do after Ruby shot Oswald? After Ruby was
taken upstairs? What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Captain Jones said, "Do you have a car out," and I told him,
"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>He said, "Get about five of these officers," and I don't remember which one,
"and go to Parkland Hospital and help them with security." And within 5
minutes after he was shot, we were on our way to Parkland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember if Sergeant Dean was out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I don't think he was. He might have been. I didn't remember
seeing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember if he went in your group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No; I am pretty sure of both of the detectives in our group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Let's see, probably after 2 o'clock, maybe 3 o'clock that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were out at Parkland Hospital, did you hear any
rumors about how Ruby got down to the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got back to the police department, did you hear any
rumors back there as to how Ruby got into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How soon after you got back to the police station were you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
asked to prepare a report to Chief Curry? Don't look at this. I want you to
do this from your own recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Probably the next day. I don't even remember. I couldn't tell
you. Somebody said, you got to write a report. But this was the second or
third one. We wrote a little report along as we went to kind of, each day we
have a daily report we turn in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you write a report at the end of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I am not sure whether I did that or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you do this. After you leave, would you check back at
the police department and find out if you did write a daily report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. If I did, it would be a special assignment. It wouldn't have anything
to do with the narcotics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would it have any details of what you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I am going to mark this map we have been working with,
"Dallas, Tex., Detective Beaty, March 26, 1964, Exhibit 5039." Now, is this
Exhibit 5039 the document that you have been making marks on during this
discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wonder if you would sign that and then date it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. [Signs and dates.] What is the date, the 26th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. All right, I am going to mark the interview report by
Agents Dallman and Quigley of the interview with you on December 3, 1963, as
"Dallas, Tex., Detective Beaty, 3-26-64&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. That happened in Garland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But we are marking it here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark what purports to be a copy of a letter which
you prepared to go to Chief Curry, which is dated November 27, 1963, and
mark that "Dallas, Texas, Detective Beaty, 3-26-64, Exhibit 5041." I want you
to look at 5041 and tell me if you had a chance to read that over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that a true and accurate copy of a letter that you sent to
Chief Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. That looks like it might be; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have read over both the interview report, Exhibit 5040,
and this letter, Exhibit 5041? Other than the changes you have already made
on Exhibit 5040, and the testimony which you have already given here today,
are there any additions or corrections that you would want to make in either
of these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. Not that I can remember or think of. I have thought about it
some since it happened to see if I could remember anything that I didn't tell the
FBI agents, and I can't think of a thing. Actually, I didn't see a whole lot of
the actual shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything that you would want to tell the Commission
that you think would be important to us in connection with our investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. I don't think of a thing. You have covered it pretty well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you and I have any interview of any sort prior to the time
we took this deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. You talked to me in the hall and said read this, is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I handed you Exhibits 5040 and 5041, but other than giving it to
you and asking you to read it before the interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you been interviewed by any other member of the Commission
staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. You are speaking of the Warren Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, other than the interview that you had with Dallman and
Quigley on December 3, 1963, do you recall whether you were interviewed by any
other Federal agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Beaty</span>. No; I am pretty sure I wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what particular part of the police department are you in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Radio patrol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is under what captain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. I work for Captain Talbert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Cecil Talbert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. I don't know his first name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Cecil Talbert. And are you in one of the prowl cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I'm going to ask you some questions about November the
24th. What time did you go on duty that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. 7:30 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then your shift would have <span class="locked">ended&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. 3:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. P.M.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you report at 7:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Well, assembly room, I guess is what you call it. We all reported
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the Dallas police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. In the basement of the city hall; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you are assigned to your cars and go cruising?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you had communication by radio, two <span class="locked">men&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. We were working two men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was with you that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. M.&nbsp;L. Wise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you actually get out on the streets and start prowling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. We received a call from the dispatcher to call 511, that is radio
patrol office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. And we called them and they advised us to come on down there as
soon as we could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you get down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. It was a few minutes after 9. I don't know exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What prowl car were you driving? Do you remember the
number of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. We were working squad 71. That is the number of the squad,
not the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have a different car number every day or drive the same
car usually?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. You mean the <span class="locked">same&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Talking about squad 71&mdash;I mean, the automobile has a number
on it, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes; I don't recall what the number&mdash;we usually have the same
one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Same car? What did you do? Park your car in <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. We took it down there and parked it in the alley there just north
of the&mdash;on Commerce at Pearl Street, and walked on down to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You parked it on Pearl Street, or in the alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. In the alley, just north of Commerce, just off Pearl Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the alleyway that runs from Pearl up to the back of the
city hall building and then makes a right to Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Has the form of an L-shape, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You put it in that alleyway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you drive it all the way up that alleyway up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No, sir; it was down close to the street there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you walked up the alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No, sir; we walked back out on the street and then down to the
building and <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't go in the building through the back door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Through that back door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you try the back door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you all parked your car near Pearl Street and
didn't even walk up or ride up the alley at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Oh, no; we walked back out and went down the street sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Went down Pearl Street to Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Went down Commerce, cut across a parking lot to Commerce,
down to the city hall that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say it was about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. A few minutes after 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. I don't know exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whom did you report to? What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. We reported to 511 patrol office, to Lieutenant Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Rio Pierce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Rio Pierce, I think you call him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What orders did he give you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. He told us just to sit down there for a few minutes, until they
decided what they wanted us to do. Then about 9:20, I guess it was, he told
me to go down to the basement and report to Sergeant Dean and Sergeant
Putnam.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Patrick Dean, I think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. P.&nbsp;T. Dean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you report to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Sergeant Putnam assigned me on what they call the elevator
area there, there in the basement at the east end of the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time were you posted there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. It would be about 9:30, I would imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were your orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. To not let anyone in except police officers and members of the
press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Into what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Into the basement area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Well, about from anywhere&mdash;see there was an elevator there
that goes to the next floor on it&mdash;in the municipal building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about the service elevator, are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir; there is a service elevator, and the other elevators, they
were not working, but the service elevator was the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know they weren't working?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Well, I presumed they wasn't. They never did open the time I
was&mdash;actual time I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you aware of a fire staircase in that general area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. There was a, I believe it is, right to the&mdash;right around the corner
from the elevators on <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Be to <span class="locked">your&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Be to the left of the elevators, I guess it would be then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you were facing the east elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir; I was in a position where I could watch it and the
elevator, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I want&mdash;you know, it won't show up on here, so, I want to
show you a map or chart of the basement area and in order to identify it so that
the record may show that we are both talking about the same thing, I am going
to ask you to sign this with me, and I am marking it, "Dallas, Texas, March 26,
1964." This will be Exhibit 5113, deposition of A.&nbsp;R. Brock. I am signing my
name beneath that and I'll ask you to sign your name just for the purposes
of identification. And now have a look at the map and I would just like you
to put, not one spot, because obviously, you can't stand in one spot, but just
sort of draw by making sort of an area, circle or oblong just the way you
walked and watched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. What I done, I was in a position here. I didn't move out of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, you can mark it then. Just put a circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. I would stay in this position where I could watch the stairs
and the elevator, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are facing, most of the time, toward Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Well, I would be facing one or the other there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where you marked the circle, I am drawing a line from it,
then I am writing, "Position of A.&nbsp;R. Brock during the time he was guarding
elevators and staircase." Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am putting a circle around that language and connecting it
by a line to the circle that you drew showing your position. I think you have
testified that all the time you were there, the regular service elevators, which
are on this chart, denoted as elevators Nos. 1 and 2, weren't working at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. They never opened them the entire time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anybody go up or down the staircase here, which I am
marking by putting in "X"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No one went in or downstairs on the staircase.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever&mdash;did you observe this first aid station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see anybody come in or go out of that the whole time
you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. At the time that I was assigned there, the doctor was in the
first aid station, and Sergeant Putnam contacted him and told him he would
have to leave the basement area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, he got out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No one entered after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By the way, I think you stated the time that you were posted,
but let's repeat it to be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. I think it was about 9:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you stayed there how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Oh, I believe it was 10:45 when I left there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now. Was there any&mdash;any people either entered or
left this service elevator during the time you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. When I first got down there there were three city employees and
the elevator operator standing there at the door of the elevator around in
front, looking around, just seeing what was going on and shortly after I got
there, I told them they would have to leave the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were they in some kind of a janitorial uniform so that you
could tell that they were employees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. I have seen them before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No, sir; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Men and women?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. There was one woman. I haven't seen her before, but from
what I gather, the way she was talking to the others, she was a telephone operator
there at the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. White woman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were they all white people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No, sir; there was one building engineer. Engineer, I believe,
is what he was called&mdash;a white man. There was a Negro, two Negroes, one was
the elevator operator, one parked cars in the basement there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you made them all go upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they come down any more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. The elevator came down one other time. Sergeant Putnam
brought one of the TV men over there, wanted to go up the fourth&mdash;fifth floor
to do some kind of work with the equipment there, and the elevator come and
picked him up and went up and brought him back in a few minutes, and that
was the only person went up or down the elevator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As long as you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you all give the elevator operator any instructions about
what he was to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. We told him to take it up on the first floor and not bring it back
in the basement, that is, open the door of it in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was after the TV man had been brought up and down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, at that point, after the TV man had been brought
up and down, he was issued instructions, "Now, don't come down here any more."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And all the time you stayed there he didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. It didn't come down any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who got off of that spot at 10:45?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Sergeant Putnam.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did he put you after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. He assigned me over to a traffic intersection where the auto was
going to take to the city jail&mdash;county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you went and helped there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You drove?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. My partner drove; M.&nbsp;L. Wise drove my car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Dropped you off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did he drop you off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Elm and Ervay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you stayed there for how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Until about 11:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who relieved you then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. 11:30 my partner picked me up and reported to Parkland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay at Parkland? What time did you get
there and what time did you leave, we'll put it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. I would just be guessing. Stayed there probably an hour or hour
and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see any reserve officers around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Parkland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. There was lots of officers out there. I don't remember seeing any
reserve officers out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Actually, can you tell the difference from the uniforms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What? The badge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. They have a patch on their arm that says, "Dallas Police Reserve
Officer," or "Reserve Officer," of some sort and they don't carry guns. All they
carry is a nightstick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a reserve officer by the name of Newman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No, sir; I don't. I don't know any of them, I don't guess, by name,
that I can recall right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Did you see another officer on duty in the basement
but closer to the ramp that runs between Main and Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. There was a, I believe, a reserve officer standing somewhere in
this area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, the arrow points&mdash;let the record show that the arrow
pointed to by the witness is being marked by me with a circle, and I am writing,
"Position of Reserve Officer, as testified to by A.&nbsp;R. Brock," and I am putting
a circle around that language and connecting it with this smaller circle. Do you
know that reserve officer's name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No, sir; I just noticed him there. I <span class="locked">didn't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he stay there about the same time you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. I believe he was still there or somewhere in that area when
I left, and there was another reserve officer assigned in this area here [indicating],<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
because he was walking around, back and forth in this area around
the staircase and around where I was assigned, also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, suppose I draw a line, I will start the line with "1," <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. I would say he went over in this area rather than come up on
it this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He went out to about the place marked "2" and I am putting
the number "1" and "2" in a circle. Now, the line "1" and "2" is where you
saw this reserve officer walking up and down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you don't know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he there when you first got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He came later? Was he there when you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I think you have read these two statements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I want to mark them for identification as follows: "An FBI
report of an interview of you made by FBI Agents Wilkinson and Hardin on
December 4, 1963, for identification. I am marking it, "Dallas, Tex., March 26,
1964. Exhibit No. 5114, deposition of A.&nbsp;R. Brock." And signing my name
underneath it. It has two pages, and so, I am placing my initials in the left-hand
corner on the second page, and I'm also marking for identification what
seems to be a copy of a letter dated November 26, addressed to Chief Curry,
the original, apparently, has been signed by you, and I am marking it, "Dallas,
Tex., March 26, 1964, Exhibit No. 5115, deposition of A.&nbsp;R. Brock." I am signing
my name. It has only one page. Now, I understand that you have read both
of these documents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any comment to make? I would like you to express
yourself as to whether those documents represent the truth and are they complete,
or do they have omissions or should anything be deleted as wrong or just
tell me your thoughts about the documents dealing first with the FBI report
which has been marked "5114"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. These are true, to the best of my memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that true of 5115, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. That would be the other one? Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any comment to make on these? Do you think they
represent what you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir; they&mdash;I think they represent all that I know about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say that between those two documents, to wit, 5114,
5115, and the material we got on the chart and your deposition, itself, that we
now know just everything you know about the matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir; do you care to add anything else in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No, sir; I don't know of anything else that <span class="locked">would&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, have you been interviewed by me or any other
member of the Commission staff prior to the starting of this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brock</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, that's all. Thank you.</p>

<p>The testimony of Detective B.&nbsp;H. Combest was taken at 9 a.m., on March 26,

Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of B.&nbsp;H. Combest. Mr. Combest, my name
is Leon D. Hubert, and I am a member of the advisory staff of the general counsel
of the President's Commission. Under the provisions of Executive Order
11130, dated November 29, 1963, joint resolution of Congress No. 137, and the
rules of procedure adopted by the President's Commission in conformance with
the Executive order and the joint resolution I have been authorized to take a
sworn deposition from you.</p>

<p>I state to you that the general nature of the Commission's inquiry is to ascertain,
evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In particular
as to you, Mr. Combest, the nature of the inquiry today is to determine
what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts
you may know about the general inquiry. Mr. Combest, you appeared here
today by virtue of a general request made to your Chief Curry by Mr. J. Lee
Rankin, general counsel on the staff of the President's Commission. Under the
rules adopted by the Commission, you are entitled to a 3-day written notice
prior to the taking of the deposition, but the rules, however, also provide that a
witness may waive this notice. Are you willing now to waive the 3-day notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you raise your right hand to be sworn, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your name, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Billy H. Combest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, your name is Billy and not William?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; it is Billy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Thirty-three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you reside, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. 2803 Linhaven, Mesquite, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mesquite, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Detective for the city of Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long have you been so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. With the department a little over 9 years. I have been a
detective about 4 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty on Sunday, November 24th, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir, I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that one of your regular working days or had you been
called in specially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, my regular working day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How well did you know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Well, I knew him very well by sight. I had seen him numerous
occasions before, over a period of approximately 4, 4½ years. I knew him
through business with the&mdash;checking his location for violations, routine checks
by the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would there be any doubt that you would recognize him as soon
as you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You would recognize him even in a crowd of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; I would have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it make any difference in your recognition if he had a
hat on or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Combest, I ask you to identify some documents and
in order for the record to show that we are talking about the same thing, I
am going to mark them. I now mark what appears to be a copy of a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
dated November 26, 1963, addressed to J.&nbsp;E. Curry, chief of police, and the
original apparently was signed by you, as, "Dallas, Texas, March 26, 1964.
Exhibit No. 5099. Deposition of B.&nbsp;H. Combest." I am signing my name Leon
D. Hubert, Jr., on the first page. On the second page, I am placing my initials
in the lower right-hand corner. I am also marking for identification what purports
to be a report of the FBI of an interview with you by Special Agents
Dallman and Quigley on December 2, 1963, consisting of four pages, putting on
this first page, in the right side margin the following, "Dallas, Texas, March 26,
1964. Exhibit No. 5101. Deposition of B.&nbsp;H. Combest." I am signing my
name on the first page below that and placing my initials in the lower right-hand
corner of the three succeeding pages. Now, Mr. Combest, you have read
the letter dated November 26, addressed to Chief Curry, which I have marked
Exhibit 5099. Does that document represent the truth, so far as you know it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any comments to make about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now let's turn to a document which I have marked
5101, which is the FBI report, and I will ask you if you have read that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you have any comments to make on that, corrections, deletions,
anything been omitted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, I want to know whether this represents a true,
full statement of the interview and what you said, or didn't say, and let's have
an explanation of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Okay, sir. On the fourth page there, the third paragraph
<span class="locked">where&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. They relate to the person named as Newman. They misunderstood
me, evidently, on that. He does work at the Theatre Lounge as it so
states there, but Ruby does not have anything to do with the Theatre Lounge.
This is another so-called strip joint in the downtown area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Here is the sentence we are talking about. "He did recall,
however, that an individual by the name of Newman, first name unknown, was
formerly district supervisor for the liquor control board, worked for Ruby at
the Theatre Lounge." Now, your statement is that that is an incorrect statement
of what you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you correct it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Well, the question was did I know of any police officers that
had worked for Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. At the time I told him, "No," I did not and I explained possibly
where they had gotten their information was that a reserve police officer
had made a statement to some news media that he had worked for Jack Ruby,
but he is not a regular policeman for the city of Dallas, and I also told him
that possibly what they had heard that this L.&nbsp;L. Newman, who formerly worked
for the Texas Liquor Control Board was working at the Theatre Lounge in the
downtown area, and possibly that was what they had heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you actually told them that there were two
Newmans involved, one who had been a reserve <span class="locked">officer&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; I do not recall the name of the reserve officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Two different individuals, one, who had been a reserve officer
and one who had been with the Texas Liquor Control Board?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your statement to them was that possibly what they were
thinking about when they were questioning you was that the Newman who had
worked for the Texas Liquor Control Board was the one you thought had once
worked for the Theatre Lounge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did Ruby have any connection with the Theatre Lounge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; none whatsoever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did, as a matter of fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. It is either Abe or Barney Weinstein. One of the brothers
owned the Theatre Lounge. One of the brothers owns the Colony Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I think that perhaps I should call your attention to the
next sentence, too, because you may want to correct it in the light of this
testimony. The next sentence which is the last sentence of the very top
paragraph of the last page of Exhibit 5101 reads as follows: "Newman terminated
his employment with the State about a year and a half ago and it
would have been possibly about that time that he started working for Ruby."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No; there again, evidently they misunderstood me. It was
possibly that time that he went to work for the Theatre Lounge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Have you any other comments to make with reference
to the FBI report, which is Exhibit 5101?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Well, I believe it is on page 3, first paragraph, in&mdash;where they
say, I didn't&mdash;didn't observe Ruby make any statement at the time of the
shooting, could not recall Ruby making statements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, I understand that you wish to comment on
or make some correction in a sentence on the third page of Exhibit 5101,
which sentence begins on the sixth line from the top of the page and reads as
follows: "As best he could recall Ruby had what could be described as a determined
look, or grimace on his face, and he could recall Ruby making no statement
in conjunction with his action." Now, I understand you want to comment
on that sentence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; it may be correct as it is said there. I don't&mdash;the
way I was&mdash;the way I say it is not exactly the way I meant it. I told them
he was talking. He was making statements but I could not recall anything
word by word to tell them or any exact words that he said at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I suppose that is true now, that you can't recall any
exact words that he said at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, can you tell us without using the exact words, the sense
of what he was saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Well, it appeared to me that at the time he was cursing Oswald,
but again, I wasn't close enough to hear the words, his exact words. I
could tell he was talking, tell he was making some statements, but I cannot
recall anything he said exactly. I wasn't that close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. In other words, what you are really changing to, instead
of the affirmative statement that you couldn't recall Ruby making any statement,
you are changing it to say you think he was saying something but you
couldn't hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What other corrections do you have then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. That's all I have, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With the corrections that you have noted in the FBI report,
which have been marked for identification as Exhibit 5101, did you consider
that the FBI report is a fair statement of what you said to the FBI agent
involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it represents the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, and so that the record may show that we are both speaking
of the same document, I would like you to sign your name below mine here on
Exhibit 5099 and initial the second page below my initial, and do the same
thing with Exhibit 5101.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir. Did you say that there was four pages on that earlier?
There are five, I believe, aren't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Beg your pardon, sure are. It has been brought to my attention
that Exhibit 5101, which I have previously identified as having four pages, in
fact, has five, and I notice now that I have failed to place my initial on the
second page, apparently having missed it, so, I now place my initial on the
second page. All being initialed now. I have marked for identification a
chart, or floor plan of the Dallas Police Department basement area showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the jail office, the parking area, down ramp from the Main Street, the upper
ramp to Commerce Street, and for the purpose of identification with this testimony,
I have marked this document as follows: "Dallas, Texas, March 26,
1964. Exhibit 5100. Deposition of B.&nbsp;H. Combest." I have signed my name
under that in order also that we may recognize that we are talking about the
same document. I will ask you to put your signature below mine on that
document, sir.</p>

<p>When did you first learn about the time of the plan to transfer Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Sometime late the preceding day that I heard it through the
news media that we were going to transfer him the next morning, and I don't
recall the exact time, but the time of transfer was supposed to be pretty early
the next morning, the way I understood it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean 5 or 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Well, 7 or 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you come on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. I believe it was 9 o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn't your shift go on at 7, your regular shift?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On Sunday it begins <span class="locked">at&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. We have a 9 to 5, and a 10 to 6 squad working Sundays.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I know that, the FBI report indicates that. But, you
reported to central police headquarters at 7 a.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; I overlooked that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is incorrect then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you want to change the first sentence of the third paragraph
on the first page? Exhibit 5101 which states you reported at 7 a.m., to show
that you reported at 9 a.m., on that Sunday, November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any particular assignment as to the transfer of
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; not before, just shortly before the transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, from 9 o'clock when you reported until you
were given the assignment which we are going to in a minute, you went about
your normal duties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, who gave you that particular assignment and what was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Well, it was Captain Jones who works in the forgery bureau
of the Dallas Police Department. He came through the basement of the jail
and talked to Detective Beaty and Officer J.&nbsp;D. Hutchinson and, I believe,
some other officers there at the time, and told us to remain in the basement
and we would be given more specific orders shortly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was that about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. I would have to refer to my letter there. I don't remember
at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The letter says 10:50 approximately 10:50, is that about right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. We remained there in the basement and shortly Captain Jones
came back off the elevator with what appeared to be all the onduty officers
in the building at that time. He told us to go outside the jail office in the
parking area and into the basement, itself, and there he would station us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; he did. When he got outside he told us to form
a line either side of the passageway leading into the ramp where the vehicles
were parked to transfer Oswald, and he gave us orders not to let anyone rush
in, not let the lines close in. He also told us to make sure that they didn't
fall in behind him, to follow him out after they had passed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, there was a line formed on either side of the jail corridor
from the jail door to the basement area where the car was to transport Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, if you will step over here, please, and have a look at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
mockup here. First of all, this is the inside jail office. This is really&mdash;this is
the corridor swinging door. This is the outside corridor of the jail door.
Now, looking at this first, try to fix your position and then I'm going to ask
you to place your position on this map once you have related this map to the
mockup, so we will have a record on this map of where you were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; would have been standing just about here [indicating],
just almost to the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am placing&mdash;is this it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am placing a circle where you say you were standing. That
is just off the corner of the intersection formed by the jail corridor and the
basement ramp, but toward the swinging door in the basement and the jail
office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And, I'm going to put there, "Position of Combest as stationed
by Jones." Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am circling that language and attaching the language to the
circle that you have indicated. Now, what time did you reach the position
that we just marked on the map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. It would have been approximately 20 minutes before the
shooting, which would have placed it at 11, wouldn't it? 11 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you remain at that position until the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, I understand that you didn't remain absolutely still,
but you didn't walk around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; I stayed in that immediate area right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember who was on your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. R.&nbsp;L. Lowery. Detective R.&nbsp;L. Lowery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am going to mark his position. That would have put him
<span class="locked">almost&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Right at the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right at the corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am marking that, encircling the language, "Position of R.&nbsp;L.
Lowery," and do you remember who was to your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Detective Beaty, Detective B.&nbsp;L. Beaty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were facing in the direction of the Main Street ramp, in
the parking area on the Main Street side of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were there for approximately 20 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you see out into the parking area on the Main Street side
of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; I could not. They completely blocked me, television
cameras and newsmen on this side&mdash;on this side of the rail, and of down in
the basement, itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am marking an area which I am going to call "area B," with
an oblong circle. Is that the area you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say that "area B," had television cameras and personnel
attending them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And other people there, so that you were unable to see into the
parking area, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I'm going to mark another area, "area A," and ask if
there were any people standing in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes; there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Roughly, how many?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. There were several officers standing here [indicating]. There
were <span class="locked">some&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say "here," you are just pointing to the Commerce
Street side of the area that I have marked "area A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; also down the line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, they were on the opposite side of the corridor from
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A semicircle curving toward Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I'm marking a line, which I am going to start off at a point
called "1," and have it curve over to a point called "2," is that approximately
the line you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, on that line from "1," to "2" you say there were a number
of detectives, or members of the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize any of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Well, I remember "Blackie," that is the nickname, Harrison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is W.&nbsp;J. Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; I believe it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was he, about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. I don't recall exactly. I know that he was on that side, and
I lost contact with him as soon as Oswald started out. I don't remember if he
had moved, or if he was still standing directly across.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was in front of the people that I have marked here in
"area B," and "area A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, other than the detective, how many people do you suppose
were in that "area A," right back of the curving line marked "1" to "2"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. It would be an estimate on it at this time. I don't recall. There
were several. I would say 15, at least.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think they were standing shoulder to shoulder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes; it was pretty crowded all the way around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would make about what, two or three ranks of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. I don't recall exactly. I know there was a very large crowd
in the basement that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about the whole basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any people in the area which I am marking roughly
by an oblong figure, "area C," which is the ramp leading from the parking area
into Main Street, Commerce Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go in there, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; there were several people there, newsmen and also,
several officers stationed in that area out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, were the television lights on all the time you were standing
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they bother you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Well, when we first came downstairs it was a little hard to
distinguish faces in this area here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. "Area B," the witness is pointing to "area B."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. And until you got used to them it was pretty hard to look into
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get used to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; I was pretty well used to them at the time the actual
transfer took place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you could distinguish faces of people in "area B"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you distinguish faces in "area A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The lights gave you no trouble by the time the transfer actually
took place, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. When did you first see Ruby in that crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Just as they started to lead Oswald past me, at the corner
there I observed him lunge from the crowd. Almost the whole line of people
pushed forward when Oswald started to leave the jail office, the door, the hall&mdash;all
the newsmen were poking their sound mikes across to him and asking questions,
and they were everyone sticking their flashbulbs up and around and over
him and in his face. I don't&mdash;when he first lunged forward I don't think anyone
noticed him. I didn't until he came apart from the crowd and continued on
towards Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did he come from the area&mdash;we have marked on this Exhibit
5100 as "area A" or as "area B," sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. The best I could tell he would be coming approximately half
way between them there, between what you have marked as "area A," and
"area B."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sort of from the corner there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like for you to take the pen and mark an "X" on the spot
that you first saw Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. About approximately [indicating], <span class="locked">because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This was really the front line "1," through "2."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I'm writing on the map, "Position where Ruby was first
seen by Combest." Was he standing still then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; he was stepping forward and&mdash;or lunging forward, I
guess would be the best way to put it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had not seen him, of course, prior to that moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you seen him in the crowd at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you seen him coming down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; when I was standing with the crowd I couldn't see
the ramp there, the Main Street ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You could see a part of it, couldn't you, the bottom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Well, no, sir; it slanted up and they had an air conditioner
sitting across here where you have to be almost in your&mdash;standing directly in
the bottom of the ramp you couldn't see the top of it very clearly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you testified that you knew Ruby's face well enough so
that you could distinguish it in a crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had looked into that crowd and your eyes had become accustomed
to the lights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I ask you if you saw him in the crowd before he lunged
forward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think you would have seen him had he been in that crowd
during the 15 minutes or so prior to that shot, the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Quite possibly if he had been there very long I believe I would
have spotted him. I might not have, but knowing that he didn't belong there
I believe I would have spotted him right off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, what precautions were taken to assure that people
who did not belong there would not be there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Well, everyone that went out into the basement from the jail
office had to have the press card, proper identification showing that they were
members of the press and police officers. Other than that no one was admitted
to the basement parking area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of press cards were honored, and what were dishonored?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Well, most of the news personnel there had the&mdash;had a press
card for that&mdash;I don't remember the wording. It was something about&mdash;"Presidential
press party," or something that they had. Of course, it was recognized
and then any other card that did have their picture on it, and it had to say
they were a member of a press, any newspaper. I remember the Oklahoma City
newspaper came in, and they were admitted with their press cards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they have to have their picture on the press cards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. The ones I checked, I remember now I wasn't actually stationed
there at the cars. There were two uniformed officers here who were actually
doing the checking. Of course, I did check some to expedite travel through that
narrow corridor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I'm trying to get at, there were no particular press cards
issued for this particular occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Not that I recall; no, sir. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember any instances in which you were involved or
in which you observed in which persons who were not properly&mdash;who didn't have
a press card, were removed or questioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; in my letter there to Chief Curry I recall there was a
girl that worked at the police information desk, which is in the basement, by the
records bureau, had went out into the basement, at least on one occasion to
summon officers that were wanted on the telephone. On the next time that I
noticed her start to go into there, she was stopped by Sergeant Putnam, as I
recall it. He advised her that she would not go into the basement if she had
messages to officers that were in the basement, and she was not to leave her
assignment behind the information desk until the transfer was over. Also, to
a civilian employee that worked in the jail booking office proper. He had came
out into the parking basement, appeared to have a look around to see what
was going on. He was told to get back behind the desk in the jail booking office
and remain there until after the transfer was over. Also, one other incident,
I think I have also put in my letter there and regarding a reporter for the Oklahoma
City News, I believe his name is Jim Standard. He did not have a press
card. He was stopped and questioned, but he did have proper identification
to prove that he did work for the Oklahoma City newspaper. He had a hospitalization
card made out to a group policy of this newspaper in Oklahoma
City. Had some letters and correspondence to him, addressed to him at that
location, and after convincing myself and Beaty, he convinced Captain Talbert
that he was a legitimate member of the press and he was admitted. Two or
3 days after the incident I was in Oklahoma City and I saw the article he had
written showing this incident in Dallas and his picture was also in the Oklahoma
City paper, and I remembered him. I recognized him. And he wrote a
pretty good article on the security in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you speak to Ruby after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear him say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Again, I heard him talking when he came into the jail office
proper, where the booking office is located. As I recall it, they laid him on
the floor to put the handcuffs on him more securely. He was talking then as
they led him past the spot where Oswald was laying, near the elevator, to take
him to jail. He was also talking. He was looking in the direction of Oswald
and was talking to the officers that were leading him away. I don't recall any
specific statement he made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear Oswald say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir. He&mdash;I didn't hear him say a word hardly, after he
had been shot. He was moaning at the time Jimmy Leavelle, Graves, and I
laid him down on the floor and removed the handcuffs that he had on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was in the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir. At the time I asked him and talked to him trying to
get him to make a statement to me at the time. Especially, after I realized how
serious the wound was. When we first asked him he appeared to comprehend
what I was saying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you ask him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Well, I told him was there anything that he wanted me to tell
anybody or was there anything he wanted to say right now before it was too
late, and I don't remember my&mdash;exactly the words that I did say to him, but
after I realized the seriousness of the wound, of course, trying to let him know
if he was ever going to say anything he was going to have to say it then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You thought he was dying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And do you think you used language to him to convey to him your
idea that he was dying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get any indication that he actually understood what
you were trying to convey to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. When I first started asking him he did. He looked up at me,
seemed to recognize that I&mdash;who was talking to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't mean that he recognized you as a person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. He recognized that I was the person talking to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, he didn't say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; just shook his head and I said, "Do you have anything
you want to tell us now," and he shook his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He did not say the word "No"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; he did not say anything at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you indicate to him that if he had any accomplices or wanted
to clarify the shooting of the President, that he had better do it right quick?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Not in those words. I didn't mention "accomplice," or anything.
I was real excited at the time but I kept talking to him as long as I thought that
he would try to answer me, hoping that he would give a dying declaration on
the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you think you used language sufficiently clear to him to
indicate to him that in your opinion he was dying and on account of the fact
that he was dying it was just about the last time he would have a chance to say
anything about the shooting of the President, or the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Ruby thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. What was the question, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Ruby, thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. I didn't see him until after he had passed through the jail office.
Now, in the jail elevator. The next time I saw him at the preliminary hearing
in Judge Brown's office in the court house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't hear him say anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you heard anything that would indicate to you that any
member of the police department actually saw Ruby in the garage prior to the
shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; not on this day, this particular day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am talking about this day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did any member of the police department ask you whether you
had seen Ruby prior to the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Lieutenant Revill, Jack Revill and Lieutenant Cornwall. Now,
they were members of a group that were investigating within the police department,
and I was interrogated by them as to if I had seen him that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your answer was the same as it <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; it was "no."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any suggestion by these gentlemen or anybody else
that you should say that you had not seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; none whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any other statements or comments that you would
like to make that have not been said or reported in any way that you know of
by you concerning the matter that we have been talking about this morning?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is your opinion, and concerning your letter, which has been
identified as 5099, the FBI report of the interview with you which has been
identified as 5101, and this deposition today represents all you know about this,
completely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And all of it is correct and true?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Now, has there been any interview between me
and you, or you and any other member of the Commission's staff other than
this deposition this morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Combest</span>. No, sir; there have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<h2 id="KHC">TESTIMONY OF KENNETH HUDSON CROY</h2>

<p>The testimony of Kenneth Hudson Croy was taken at 10:30 p.m., on March 26,
1964, in the office of the U.S. Attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. My name is Burt Griffin, and I am a member of the advisory
staff to the General Counsel of the President's Commission on the assassination
of President Kennedy. This Commission was set up under Presidential Resolution
No. 11130, signed by President Johnson on November 29, 1963, and also pursuant
to a joint resolution of Congress No. 137. As a result of this Presidential
Executive order and the Presidential resolution, the Commission has been given
authority to promulgate certain rules of procedure, and I have been authorized
in accordance with those rules to take your sworn deposition, Mr. Croy.</p>

<p>I want to explain to you a little bit first before we go forward with the
deposition of what this testimony, why we are taking the testimony. The Commission
has been set up for the purpose of investigating, evaluating, and reporting
back to the President on all of the facts surrounding the assassination of
President Kennedy and the subsequent murder of Lee Harvey Oswald. We are
particularly concerned here today in calling you, with delving into the events
surrounding Oswald's death, although if you have any other information that
you feel would be useful to us in any other areas of our inquiry, we would like
very much to have that.</p>

<p>Now, I also want to explain to you, Mr. Croy, that you have been asked to
appear here today as a result of a letter which was sent by Mr. J. Lee Rankin,
who is the general counsel of the Commission, to Chief Curry, and your name was
listed on that and Chief Curry arranged to set up the schedule. I should tell you
that under the rules of the Commission you are actually entitled to get a 3-day
written notice before we can require you to appear here. However, we do have
a provision in the rules that permit you to waive the notice if you are agreeable
to it.</p>

<p>Now, the first thing I want to do is ask you if you would like us to send you
the letter, and I want to make it clear that we do send these letters out as a
routine matter, and if for any reason you feel that you would like to have
advance notice and so forth, that we haven't really given you, why feel free to
tell me now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I would just have to come back down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then you are willing to waive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I also want to explain to you that you have a right to be
represented by counsel before this Commission and again, many of the people
are represented by counsel. I want you to understand that we, in fact, encourage
people to come here with an attorney if they feel there is any reason at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
that it might be useful to them. I see that you are not here with an attorney
right now, and I presume that this is of your own choice.</p>

<p>However, if you would like to have an attorney, I wish you would let me
know about it and we would be happy to make arrangements for further
time when you could have one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't see what I would need an attorney for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, I think in most cases it is not really necessary, except
from the attorney's standpoint.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. He gets paid for doing nothing anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, some of them do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. This one does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you an attorney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No. I have my own attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I shouldn't have asked that question. All right, if it is agreeable
with you, I will ask you to raise your right hand and I will administer
the oath.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you give us your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Kenneth Hudson Croy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. 1658 Glenfield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. February 21, 1937.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I have several.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let's have them in order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I am in the real estate business. I have a Mobil service station.
I am in the steel erection business. And I am a professional cowboy, and
that is about it that I can think of right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We Yankees up North don't know what professional cowboys are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Rodeo. You got rodeos up North.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; they come up once in a while and alternate with circuses.
How long have you been doing that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Oh, about 12 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I would not like to waste all the court reporter's time talking
about this, I don't think the Commission would probably be too interested.</p>

<p>Are you also connected in some way with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I am in the reserves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been in the reserves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Since August of 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you hold any rank in the reserves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I am a sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I am going to take out a little time here and mark two
documents. One of them is a report of an interview that you had on December 4,
1963, with FBI Agents John E. Dallman and R. Neil Quigley.</p>

<p>I have marked this particular document that I just referred to "Dallas,
Tex., Mr. Croy, 3-26-64, Exhibit 5051."</p>

<p>I want to hand this to you, Mr. Croy, and ask you if you have had an opportunity
to read that over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this: Do you have any additions, deletions, or
corrections that you feel should be made in that report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you are satisfied with the report, let me ask you then to
sign it and date it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Where at?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the front page there some place near where we have marked
it with an exhibit number, some conspicuous spot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. [Signs name.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I am marking what purports to be a copy of a letter
dated November 26, 1963, addressed to Chief Curry and signed by you in the
following manner: "Dallas, Tex., Mr. Croy, 3-26-64, Exhibit 5052."</p>

<p>Would you look at this, Mr. Croy, and would you tell me if you have had an
opportunity to read that over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any additions, deletions, or corrections that you
would make with the respect to the accuracy of that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay, would you sign that and date it also in the same manner
that you did the other one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. [Signs and dates.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I have also marked for identification what purports to be
a copy of an affidavit in fact, sworn to before A.&nbsp;L. Curtis, a notary public,
by you on December 1, 1963, and I have marked that "Dallas, Tex., Mr. Croy,
3-26-64, Exhibit 5053."</p>

<p>I am going to hand you that, Mr. Croy, and ask you if you have had an opportunity
to look that over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is that a true and accurate copy of an affidavit which you
prepared on that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you then sign it and date it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. [Signs and dates.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you report to the jail or the police department on Sunday,
November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About what time did you come in, do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, your letter of November 26 indicates you came in at 8:35?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. That is probable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, sometime after you came in, you were assigned to guard
a particular area of the basement; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you tell us what you were assigned to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. When I came into the city hall, I went to the assembly room, and
that is where any initial assignments are made, in the assembly room, making
up the muster and the roster of the reserve officers that arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, I was in and out of there, between there and the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain on that duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I never was relieved from that duty. I went in there, but I never
was relieved from it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you have stated in your letter to Chief Curry of November
26, 1963, in paragraph 3, "I was assigned to the basement and jail office entrance,
and my assignment was that of a guard."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, that was in the entire thing down there is what&mdash;everyone
in the basement was considered a guard at the same time, if you are standing
in front of the entrances, elevators, or in the back of the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you never had any particular station of duty there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No. I wasn't just assigned a spot and told to stay there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did there come a time when you stationed yourself at the
foot of the Main Street ramp in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About when was that? For how long before Oswald came out,
would you estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, I couldn't really estimate, because it has been almost 4 months
ago and I don't really know how long it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, when you took up your position at the base of the ramp,
had the armored car arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The armored car was already there? You weren't there at any
time when the armored car was not there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Can you give us any statement of how long you were
there? Were you there for 2 minutes prior to the time Oswald came down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I was longer than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you there 15 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I couldn't say. I don't remember whether I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You think you were there as long as 5 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about as long as 10 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I couldn't say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you remain in one general area when you stationed yourself
at the bottom of the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you come to be stationed at that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. There was another officer, a regular officer, I believe, commented
that they needed at least three more officers at that particular position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who that regular officer was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I don't. I don't even know who he was. I just remember
there was a regular officer, supervisory officer in uniform stated they needed at
least three more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he state this to you personally, or were you in a group at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I was just standing out there on this ramp leading into the basement
where the two ramps lead down into the basement, and he stepped out
there, and as well as I remember, just made a quick check and pointed out that
he needed at least three men at that location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, from the time that you finished doing your clerical work
when you first came in, until you all were ultimately stationed at the base of
the Main Street ramp, did you have any particular responsibilities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes. There were several reserve officers that were coming right
directly into the basement, and the first reported to the assembly room to get
their assignments or be told what to do.</p>

<p>I would take these men and take them in there and get them mustered in on
the roster so we would know they were there and have a record.</p>

<p>I would either tell them where to report, or take them to a certain station
and station them there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, do you recall if you were in the basement when Captain
Jones was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if you were in the basement when a group of
regular police officers, detectives and so forth came into the basement from
the public elevators that go up into the police building, and walked through the
swinging door and were given assignments by a regular officer of some sort?
Were you there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't guess I was; I don't recall it at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, while you were stationed at the base of the
Main Street ramp, do you recall if you saw any cars go in and out of the
basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. There was one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You saw one car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, during the period that you were in the basement generally
before you were stationed at the ramp, did you see any cars go in and out of the
garage or basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you describe how much traffic there was?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No. There wasn't any squads bringing prisoners in, that I recall.
I don't recall any of that.</p>

<p>I recall one car leaving, going up the south ramp, one car that I know of, because
I knew who was in that car.</p>

<p>And other than that one and the one that went up the north ramp, I don't
recall any other cars going out of the basement area. There could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how much before you saw that one last car go up the
Main Street ramp, how long would you say you had been in the basement?
How long before that had you been at your station in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me start over again. How long had you been at this station
which you had at the base of the Main Street ramp prior to the time that the
last car went up the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. How long had I been in the basement before then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long had you been in the general area at the base of the
ramp? Continuously?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know, I guess a couple or 3 minutes, something like that. I
remember that because he nearly ran over my toes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were standing at the base of the ramp prior to the
time that the car went up the ramp, do you remember whether any equipment
of any sort was moved into the basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Equipment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Just anything moved in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall any activities of newspaper people or of TV
people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Oh, they were milling all over the place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall any movement of equipment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember a TV camera being rolled through the swinging
double doors at the entrance, almost at the entrance to the Main Street ramp
or the bottom ramp, and being wheeled in any direction? Being pushed, a TV
camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't recall any bringing in there. They had them down there
in the basement all morning, that I remember. I don't remember bringing in
any more in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you recall the three TV cameras being stationed
there? At this point I would like to hand you my pen and ask you if you would
mark on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. You want an "X"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Make a rectangle and write TV inside of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. [Marks.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you have indicated on the map that there were two behind
the railing, sort of directly opposite the hallway that leads out from the double
doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that there was a third one over against the railing of the
entrance to the garage closer to Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you sure that all of those were placed in that position that
they were in, or do you think they could have been someplace else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. They were placed there when I walked in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Would you tell us what happened at the time that this
automobile went up the Main Street ramp? Which side of the automobile were
you standing on? Were you standing between it and the railing, or were you
standing between it and the wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. It and the wall on the left hand side of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how many people were in that area, would you say, in
the general area across from the wall that you were near, and the railing across?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Police officers and press?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many would you say were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I couldn't say. I don't know. There was several there. They
were all standing out in here, and when the car came out, everybody had to
get out of the way and let the car get through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you make any effort to help push the people back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As cars went up the ramp and got ahead of you people, what did
you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I watched it go up the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see it stop at the top of the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I just watched it going up the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see the police officer there at the top of the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Not at that time, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At what point did you lose sight? Where was the car when
you lost sight of the car at the top of the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. When he got almost to the top of the ramp, I turned back around.
I didn't watch it drive on out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. As you looked around, did you see anything of significance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did there come a time when somebody gave you instructions to
move the press back against the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes, sir; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Prior to them bringing Oswald down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that before or after the car went up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. It was after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it any substantial length of time after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what makes you sure that it was after the car went up the
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Because it was just prior to them bringing, just prior to them bringing
him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, if you were told that, if you were to assume that that car
moved out of the ramp, approximately 1 minute before Oswald was shot, would
you still feel that this order to move the people back from the railing was
given after the car went up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, you think it could have been as little as, no
more than a minute after the car went up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know how long it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you feel it was more than a minute after the car went up the
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You think this order was given more than a minute after the
car went up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was the officer standing who gave that order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Somewhere in this general area. He just stepped out of the little
hallway leading to the jail office. I don't know who it was. He was a
detective.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. In plain clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You saw him emerge from the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He said move everybody back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, he didn't say move everybody back. He said move back
against the railing. At that particular time they were all crowded out in here
and all the way around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are indicating the area right in front of the TV cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. And he said, move the press back against the railing, this group
right here. They didn't move them back because they wasn't actually&mdash;what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
they were trying to do was clear a hall because they were crowded right up
to the entrance right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say there was a group that was standing across the Main
Street ramp that wasn't pushed back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you standing? Would you mark on the diagram
where you were standing when the order was given to push the people back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Do you want me to put an "X"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Put a "C" in there and put a circle around it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. [Complies.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you turn around and move the crowd back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. There was a man with a camera, movie camera, sitting on his
shoulder, standing next to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which direction were you facing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I was facing to the south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Toward Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes; he would have been to my left. And there was also another
fellow standing just slightly in back of him.</p>

<p>And when he gave this order to move the people back, I thought he referred
to everyone moving against the rail, because I was in back of this other group
of the press. I didn't bother with them. I let the ones in front of them take
care of them, and I turned to the man with the camera and this other fellow
and told them to move back against the rail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you recognize this other fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, then, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I turned back around and watched the reporters in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see someone there that you recognized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where the reporters were in front of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, maybe I don't understand your affidavit here. You
stated in here, "someone in authority gave instructions to move the press back
against the rail. At that time I turned and told two men standing to my left
to move back against the rail. One of these men had a motion picture camera.
The other one was in a dark maroon coat with black thread woven into it.
He was wearing a black hat. My father has a coat something similar to the man
I spoke to.</p>

<p>"I then turned my attention back to the reporters which were standing in
front of me. I believe this man to have been Jack Ruby."</p>

<p>The "to" is underlined. Which man are you referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. The man with the maroon coat that was standing to my left.
The other man I told to move back against the rail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Miss Reporter, would you please turn back in your notes and
read where he referred to the position of the reporters?</p>

<p>(The following questions and answers were read:</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see someone there that you recognized?</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Where?</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where the reporters were in front of you?</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.")</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will the reporter please indicate in the record what portion
was read back to the witness?</p>

<p>Now, you heard the reporter read back that testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don't understand. You have said here, if I understand it in
your affidavit, that you saw a man whom you believed to be Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I believe when I wrote that up it was him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Now, have you since come to believe that that man
wasn't Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You still believe that man was Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. To myself, I still believe it was Jack Ruby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know whether it was or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us how you came to believe that man was Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, as I was standing there and this blur came from my left,
someone running, and he run by me at a pretty good clip, he was gaining
momentum and he ran by me. I got a glimpse of his coat and the coat matched
the one that I had told this fellow to move back. At least it seemed to me
it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that man over against the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; after I turned my attention back to the reporters, I glanced
back over my shoulder to see if they had done what I told them to, and the
man with the camera had gotten on the railing where could get a good shot. The
other fellow, I didn't see him.</p>

<p>I didn't turn completely all the way around to see if he was in back of me.
I just glanced over my shoulder, so I presume he had gotten against the railing
or had moved around with the other reporters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how far were you from the railing after you pushed the
reporters back over in that direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I didn't push them. I asked them to step back over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I was standing about midways to the ramp. Do you know how
wide that ramp is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there a line, a group of people in front of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this group, was it sort of in a line that stretched across
from the wall to the railing across the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many people would you say were stretched across there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know. There was quite a few there, but I have no idea
how many were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were there any people&mdash;as you turned back, were you also
part of a line, a second line? Were you part of a second line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Not that I know. I was just standing there. There were other
officers to my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, one straggled line, this first line in front of
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you stating there was a fairly solid front line of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. About two deep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you behind that group of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I was behind them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How far behind them were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Oh, a couple of feet or 3 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Back where you were standing, were people as closely bunched
up as other people were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. There wasn't anyone to my left other than the two people I told
to move back. To my right there were several other officers standing there
with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Captain Arnett one of the officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you show us where Captain Arnett was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. [Marks.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many people were to Captain Arnett's right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say there was nobody to your left except a man with
a movie camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. He got back upon the railing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time this man got up on the railing, there was nobody
that you can recall to your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, will you place on the map, on that chart, where you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
think Ruby, where you saw this man that you believe to be Ruby, moved from
and to? Could you show us where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Do you mean after I told him to move?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know where he moved to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was he when you first saw him moving? Did you see
him moving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Maybe I don't understand you. As he ran into the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. After Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Where did I see him again? About right there [pointing].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Up in front of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes; well, to my side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Would you put a "R" there where you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. [Makes mark.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was there anybody in front of him at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes; there was reporters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There were reporters. Now, what did he do as he got to these
reporters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. He ran through them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he push them aside, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see him push them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see a man shoved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which man got shoved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. These reporters. He just lowered his head and ran through them
like a fullback went through a line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you feel this man move by you, or did you first see his
motion when he was in front of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Caught a glimpse of his motion. I have a wide range. I could
see over here. I saw a blur coming in, and, of course, by the time I turned,
he was in position. He was already in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, you can't tell from how far he had been running, can
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you able to tell if he had taken more than one step before
you had seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. He had a good head of steam up, I will put it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know Captain King?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know Detective Blackie Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you describe the people that you saw Ruby push through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, it was just a group of reporters there trying to get closer
to Ruby. I mean to Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any police officers near Ruby at the time that he
moved through that line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. There were no uniform police officers. If there were some detectives
there, I don't know, because I didn't know any of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, during this period that you were down in the basement,
the 5-minute period that you were in the basement, were you able to distinguish
the plainclothes detectives from the newspaper people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I was in the basement longer than 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The period that you were stationed at the base of the ramp, the
15 minutes or more, were you able to distinguish the uniformed officers from
the newspaper people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Uniformed officers; yes. The detectives; no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You couldn't distinguish them? All right. Are you able to describe
the relative size of the newspaper reporters that Ruby moved there, in
comparison to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; because this man had run through, Ruby, if it was Ruby, was in
a crouch. He was running low. The newspapermen were of average height and
average build.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How could you tell that the two men he pushed were newspaper
reporters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know. They might have been police officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anybody that he pushed by have a camera in his hand or
microphone or a pad of paper or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't recall whether they did or not. They were actually standing
in front of me and I was looking at their backs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you seen yourself in any photographs that have been
taken of the basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember where you saw that photograph? Was it a
photograph in a magazine or newspaper or something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A TV film?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what station you saw that on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. All of them. No; I don't. They just ran it and ran it and reran
it, and every time I was in the room, someone said, "There you are," and I looked
again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this a showing that the police department made to you, or
were you shown any films by the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You saw this film on the regular, your home TV set, something
like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall in any of these films a shot of Ruby standing
behind a very large man, standing right up at the back of a very large man, a
very tall man, a man perhaps a head taller than he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you were shown these particular movie films, TV films that
you saw, could you pick yourself out for us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, the ones that I saw were the ones that I was trying to get
the gun from Ruby, and the ones that they had taken after it was all over, and
I was standing in the entrance to the jail office. Those are the only ones I
have seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn't see a picture of yourself at the time Ruby started
to move out toward Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I saw the reruns of it when he ran in there and shot him,
but I wasn't visible in that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did any one of these films that you watched show you reaching
out and touching the coat of Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; none that I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you met Jack Ruby before, haven't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how many occasions had you seen Jack Ruby before he
came into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Once, that I can recall. I may have seen him many times before
that, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As a reserve officer, do you have occasion to ride duty in the
downtown area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Sometimes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how often would you say you did duty in the downtown
area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Requires once a month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there any particular man that you always did duty with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes; there was one that I did ride quite a bit with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. J.&nbsp;W. Dyson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I mean in the downtown area, was there one that you rode with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I didn't ride in any particular downtown area over twice since
I have been in the reserves, I don't guess. As a district in the downtown area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you have occasion to ride out in the area of the Vegas
Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How often would you ride in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I have ridden out there a couple or three times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you ride that area with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know. I just went to the substation and checked out with
the squad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Officer Dyson assigned to that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; he is an APB.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is West Illinois Avenue anywhere near the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about around 1720 South Lamar, is that anywhere near?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you ever testified in any court case before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after Ruby shot Oswald, did there come a time when you
ran up the Main Street ramp and stopped reporters leaving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long was that after this scuffle on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. That is hard to say, because it was right there, you might say,
right with the scuffle on the floor that they said "seal the basement."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you stand up there at the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Oh, just a few minutes. Then I moved to the entrance into the
jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. A good while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then what time did you go off duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. It was about 8 o'clock that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. During that period, did you tell anybody that you had seen a
man brush by you who you thought was Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you tell at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Lieutenant McCoy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Reserve Lieutenant McCoy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't recall if I mentioned it or not to Reserve Lieutenant Nicholson,
I may have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Nicholson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did Lieutenant McCoy say when you told him that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't recall what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did you tell him about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. We were just talking about it later on that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, what were you saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. We were just talking about what happened in the basement, where
he was at and where I was at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you speculating about where he came from or how he got
in or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. A little bit, I am trying to figure out what the heck happened, really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there other officers in the basement doing that also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. They were doing it just between theirselves. There wasn't any
group talking about it, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time was it that you talked, approximately, to Lieutenant
McCoy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Oh, I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, was this, you say, a short time after you left your position
up on the Main Street ramp, or was it a long time after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. It was a pretty good while after. An hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. An hour or so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, between the time that you told this Lieutenant McCoy
and you went off duty, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I sat up in the city planning room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was up there in the city planning room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Lieutenant McCoy and Reserve Lieutenant Barney Merrell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anybody else you can recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Reserve Lieutenant Nicholson. And there was Captain Solomon
up there, and Captain Arnett, and several other reserve officers, that we kind of
set up a command post, is actually what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were you doing up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Making assignments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was giving you directions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Lieutenant McCoy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What sort of assignments were you making?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Placing the men in different spots throughout the city hall and
seeing that they were relieved, and calling on the telephone to get some more
help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have some time to sit around and talk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you talk about what you had seen down in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you tell these men out there about Ruby brushing past you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I talked to Lieutenant McCoy about it. I don't know whether
Mike Nicholson and Merrell were there at that particular time or not. I don't
know whether they overheard what we were talking about or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did Captain Solomon at that time make any request that
people write reports about what they had seen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you aware that the regular officers, these other people who
had been down in the basement, were being asked to make reports?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I didn't know they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you expect that you would be asked to make a report of
what happened in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You expected that while you were sitting up there in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I had a pretty good hunch they would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, this statement which we have marked, a letter which we
have marked Exhibit 5052, which is a copy of a letter that you prepared for
Chief Curry, dated November 26, 1963, was that prepared down in the police
department, or was that prepared at one of your business offices?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. That was prepared at the Dallas Police Academy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where is that located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. On Shorecrest back of the northwest substation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that prepared by hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you responsible for getting the typing done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you turn that report over to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Captain Solomon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then was it his responsibility to get the typing done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know. I just turned it in. What he did with it, I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did it eventually come back to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The typed copy never came back to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you seen a copy of that statement since you signed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Just a while ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there any question in your mind but that the statement that
you signed is a complete and accurate copy of the statement that you prepared
in your own hand in the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what day it was, the day you prepared that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. The following Tuesday night. I don't know what date it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, Mr. Croy, why didn't you mention in this report, dated
November 26, your seeing this man you believe to be Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Why didn't I mention that in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Because at that time Captain Solomon told me that there would
be another report made and I would have to go downtown to the city hall before
a stenographer, and he told me just to leave that out for the time being, and put
this in this other affidavit that you have, that this right here was just basically
to find out where we were in the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then when you prepared this other statement on December 1,
who called you and how did you come to go before Notary Public A.&nbsp;L. Curtis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. He is a lieutenant. After I signed it, I took it there to be notarized
by him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, then, how did you happen to&mdash;was this done in the police
department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to go to the police department that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. They called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who called you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Captain Arnett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you meet Captain Arnett down at the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with him before this statement was drawn up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you talk to before the statement was drawn up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Lieutenant Revill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Lieutenant Revill have any information before him about
this, about your having seen Ruby? Did Lieutenant Revill have any information
before him about your having seen Ruby go into the, brush by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He didn't have any information to that effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to be called down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Because of my position in the basement where I was standing
when he shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, what did Captain Solomon say to you when
you told what you had seen to Revill? Did Revill indicate that he had heard
about this before, about your having been a witness to this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was anybody else there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes; Lieutenant, I think his name is Cornwall, he was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did either of them indicate surprise by having seen this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You got the impression from the way they spoke, or any impression
from the way they spoke, that they had heard this information before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, they didn't act surprised. They didn't act like they didn't
know about it. It kind of tied in with the other reports that they had gotten,
I presume, from the way they acted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what was the general attitude on their part in the taking
of these statements. Did you feel that there was some, Cornwall and
Revill were concerned about this situation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes; they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How would you describe their general attitude in this interview?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. They were very interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, can you tell me more about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; well, I will put it this way, that it took us 8 hours to get that
up. That is how interested they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You talked with them for 8 hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. On 2 different occasions. That day and the next day, for 4
hours each day. That is pretty interesting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Croy, I take it that you actually talked to them on November,
the last day of November was the first time you talked to them, and then you
signed this on the first day of December?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. What it was, the stenographer took it, and then she typed it up.
Then the next day I went back down there and they re-read it to me and went
over and over and over and over the same thing over and over again. And
then I took it into Lieutenant Curtis and signed it and had it notarized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that examination the way you and I have been going back
and forth here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there a number of drafts to this statement? You say
it took you 2 days to draw this up. Had you written a number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you write something first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they take notes as you talked with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; we talked the entire thing over, and after we talked everything
over and they brought the stenographer in and we went back over it
again, then I left and she typed it up, and I came in the next day and we went
back over it again and back over it and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were they critical of you in any way for not having ejected
Ruby the first time that you saw him in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you indicate to them at that time that you didn't know
who he was when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes; I didn't know who he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you first saw this man, did you believe that he was a
newspaper reporter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you tell that to Lieutenant Revill and Captain Cornwall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark this "Ruby location at the time Croy saw
him moving toward Oswald." Is that a fair description of what the hieroglyphics
on here mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark this "Dallas, Tex., Mr. Croy, 3-26-64,
Exhibit 5054," and what I have marked on is the chart upon which you made
a certain mark while you described to me what happened when you saw a
man you believed to be Ruby run toward Oswald.</p>

<p>Now, let me ask you to sign that, if you believe that is an accurate copy
of the real McCoy. Would you date it also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. [Signs and dates.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you have any other information that you could provide
the Commission of any significance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. None other than what we have talked about right here.</p>

<p>(Statement to witness by court reporter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, tell me about your conversation that you had with
our court stenographer here prior to coming in here, about Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Oh, it was at the scene over where Officer Tippit was killed, at
the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you at the scene when Tippit was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Unassigned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it you are nodding your head?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time were you at the scene where Tippit was killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I watched them load him in the ambulance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Were you on reserve duty that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes. I was stationed downtown in the, I believe it was the
1800 or 1900 block of Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you in a patrol car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I was on foot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you in uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. In uniform.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you at the time President Kennedy was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Sitting in my car at the city hall. I would guess, I don't know,
because I didn't know he was shot until, I guess, several minutes after it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that where you were located when you heard he was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No. I was on Main Street trying to go home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were driving your car down Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About where were you on Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Griffin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Griffin Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do when you heard that President Kennedy had
been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I didn't do anything. I was right in the middle of the street
with my car hemmed in from both sides. I couldn't go anywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As soon as you got unhemmed, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I went by the courthouse there and there were several officers
standing there, and I asked if they needed any help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you drive your car to the courthouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which courthouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. There was only one courthouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a county courthouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. There is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a Federal courthouse, also, but this is the one right
there by the plaza and near the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. The old red courthouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that the corner of Houston and Main?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Houston and Main and Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long after you heard that President Kennedy was shot
did you arrive there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Oh, I guess it took me at least 20 minutes to drive those few blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time would you say it was when you arrived at the
courthouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you see when you arrived there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Oh, there was some officers standing on the corner, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you inquire of somebody there if you could be of assistance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Whom did you inquire of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know. They were just standing on the corner, and I asked
if I could be of any assistance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I proceeded on home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which way did you drive home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Out Thornton to Colorado, and Colorado to&mdash;I can't think of the
street. It was Marsalis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Or Zangs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Thornton to Zangs?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Thornton to Colorado to Zangs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then out Zangs and in a westerly direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No. That is when I heard the call on Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were at the corner of Zangs and Colorado?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. When the call came out on Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I proceeded to the location where Tippit was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I think it was in the 400 block of East 10th, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what street intersection that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you describe that area out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Just residential.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Where Tippit was killed, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This area that you went to where Tippit was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, the street where he was killed was a residential area. The
street immediately south of that, Jefferson, is business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Now, I am just referring to the street you found him on.
When you got there, was Tippit's car there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Tippit there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. They were loading him in the ambulance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were other officers on the scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. None that I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Got me a witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you get ahold of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. It was a woman standing across the street from me. I don't recall
her name. She gave me her name at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did she tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. She told me that she saw Tippit get out of the car, and I don't
recall, I think she said he stepped back a couple of foot and shot him and then
ran. She was pretty hysterical at that particular time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did she tell you where she first saw Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't recall whether she did or not. There was, as I recall,
there was 2 people who saw it. No; 3. A man in a, taxicab driver. However,
she was the main eyewitness, as far as I could make out. She saw the actual
shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you talk with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Oh, a good 5 or 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any other officers there with you when you were
talking with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes; and no. I talked to her, and then they talked to her, and then
I talked to her, and just after I located a witness, the squad did get there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This conversation all took place near the scene of the Tippit
killing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Leaning up against his car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as you and the other officers talked with her, did she tell
you where she was that she first saw Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't recall whether she did or not. She was pretty hysterical
and not much that she said made too much sense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was she saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. She talked very incoherent at that particular time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What information were you able to get out of her at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. The only information I could get out of her was the description
of what Oswald had on, and him shooting him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did she tell you at that time that he had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't recall what he had on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did she tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't recall what it was. She just gave a description there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you file any report of your activities this day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember the names of the other officers who were there
with you when you were interviewing this woman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I know them on sight. They all work in Oak Cliff and I don't
know the names. I just know when I see them driving down the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with the taxi driver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes; I did. I talked to the taxi driver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you talk with him on the scene of the crime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what his name was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I didn't get his name. There was a private detective agency.
There was a report that a cabdriver had picked up Tippit's gun and had left,
presumably. They don't know whether he was the one that had shot Tippit, or
whether the man, I think it was he, brought someone out there, something.
Anyway, he saw it and he picked up Tippit's gun and attempted to give chase or
something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There was a detective who was an eyewitness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; he brought the taxi driver back to the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But the taxicab driver was an eyewitness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. As far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to the taxicab driver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I took Tippit's gun and several other officers came up, and I
turned him over to them and they questioned him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, who was the third eyewitness that you say you talked
with there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I believe it was a man that was standing there in the yard. He
said he saw Oswald just walk up the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What direction did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. He didn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But he saw Oswald walking some blocks to where he got to before
he got to Tippit's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he tell you that he saw Oswald do walking up the
street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. He just said he saw him walking up the street, and this other lady
said that, I believe it was, that Tippit had stopped him and called him over to
the car, and he came around to the driver's side, because Tippit was by himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Oswald came around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. To the driver's side of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is the lady that said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. The lady said that, and she said, I think she said, he stuck his head
in the car and they talked, and he stepped back a couple or 3 feet, and Tippit
opened the door to get out, and when he got out, Oswald pulled the pistol out and
shot him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is a lady? The man or the lady that said this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. The lady.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did the man who was walking, who saw Oswald
walking up the street, tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. He just said he saw him walking up the street just prior to the
shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he say he saw him arrive at the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I turned him over to some other officers and they talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you able to determine from them what direction he saw
Oswald walking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall this man's name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I found the witness and took him to the other officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after the Tippit&mdash;how long did you remain at the scene of
the Tippit killing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Oh, I would say a good 30 minutes. Thirty or forty minutes, something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then where did you go?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Home. I went to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it, at some restaurant or something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you remain home the rest of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you come to the police department on <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I believe it was the next day. No; that was the 22d. Saturday,
I didn't go to the police department that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were at the scene of the Tippit killing, did you inquire
there as to whether or not you could be of any assistance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, when I left, I asked them if they thought they needed me
any longer, and they said, "No," so I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, have you been interviewed by an FBI agent or any agent
of the Federal Government with respect to what you have just told us here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you been interviewed by any member of the Dallas Police
Department with respect to what you have told us here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did any of the&mdash;how many police officers came out to the scene
of the Tippit killing while you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know. There was a slew of them. That would be hard
to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any officers there that you knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. There were several officers there that I knew. I don't know their
names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any officers there that you knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I am sure there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. The same way I know them, just by sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, do you have anything else of value that you know you could
contribute to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know the name of the woman you talked to across the
street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't recall. I think she lived across the street. She was standing
out in front watering her yard or doing something in her yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you have the impression that she lived across the street, in
a house across the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I believe she did. I am not sure either, or it was in the neighborhood
and she was there in the yard. She was across the street when it
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, you stated that she was watering her yard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Or something. She was standing in the yard doing something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But the first thing you indicated was, she had been watering her
yard? Apparently that was something that stuck with you from, of course,
talking with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't remember what she said she was doing. She was doing
something in the yard, and I presume that is where she lived was across the
street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you have occasion to go to the theatre where Oswald
was apprehended?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or go near there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I went by it, yes; within a block of it on the way home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had Oswald been apprehended by the time you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. They were on their way up there. There had been a report that
he had gone into the Texas Theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you listening to your police radio?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No. I was standing at the scene, and there had been several
reports. One, that he, of course, they said that the killer did go into a church,
which was in sight of where they were at. And another report, that he had
gone into the library over on Jefferson. And they had all, most of the officers
except maybe one or two had left the scene where Tippit was killed and gone
to the spot.</p>

<p>And as I got ready to leave, there was another report that he ran into the
Texas Theatre, a man fitting Oswald's description had ran into the Texas
Theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That was about the time you got into the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Just as I was fixing to leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have your police radio on in your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you drove over there by the&mdash;near the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, I drove on up 10th Street. I believe it was 10th Street. On
up to Zangs, and when I got to Zangs, took a left, and at the end of Zangs, at
the corner of Zangs and Jefferson, it is just a block away, I could see them
rushing out to the front and the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do as you saw them rushing out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. They had more help than they needed, so I went on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you continue to listen to your police radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear anything more over the radio about what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No. I only had channel 1 on my radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How far a drive is it from the Texas Theatre to where you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. About 3 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long does it take to drive that distance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. About 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you actually see these men rushing into the Texas Theatre
from your automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you know they were going into the, men were rushing
into the theatre just as you went by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. There were three cars in the back and about three in the front,
and there wasn't nobody in them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You drove right by the front of the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I drove within a block, but it is a big, wide street there, and there
is an alley and nothing on the other side of the street, parking lots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many cars could you see there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I would say there were two or three in the back and two or three
in the front, plus another on the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, the street that you took, did that go by the front or
the back of the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. It didn't go by either one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which street was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Zangs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many blocks is it from the theatre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. One.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What street is the theatre on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What street does it back on to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. In backs into an alley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Into the alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many feet would you say that Jefferson or the Texas
Theatre is from Zangs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I don't know. I would say not a very long block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you were driving up Zangs, I take it you were driving
away from town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. South.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. South on Zangs at Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you continue south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I continued south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you proceed to your home from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, I didn't go home. I went to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you go to eat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Austin Barbecue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where is that located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. On the corner of Hampton and Illinois.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you get to Hampton and Illinois?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. From Zangs to Illinois.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. West.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that left or right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. It is a right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then how far up Illinois to Hampton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Oh, I would say a long ways. It is a good stretch. Zangs Place
is about the 300 or 400 block and Illinois intersects at about the 2100 or 2200
block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How far driving was it from the Texas Theatre to this place that
you had dinner or lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, it is about three-quarters of a mile from my house, so it is 3
miles from there, so about 2½ miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, from the diner what route did you drive to your house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Straight up Illinois, west on Illinois.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is your house on Illinois?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what time you arrived at the diner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see anybody there that you knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. My wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have an appointment to meet your wife there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time was your appointment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Well, I saw her downtown and I was supposed to have gone right
straight over there. I was supposed to have gone by my mother's, and I got
detoured down at Tippit, and I was a little bit late, and she was a little mad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what time you were supposed to meet her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No; I just saw her downtown, and we were going to eat. She was
in her car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you see her downtown? Where were you and she
when you saw each other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. At the courthouse. She pulled up beside me. I asked if anybody
needed me there, and they said, "No," and here she comes and I said, "Do you
want to get something to eat?" And she said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You said you would be right there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I was going to change my uniform and my clothes were over at
my mother's and dad's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So then as you drove out to change your clothes, what did you
do? Did you hear something? How did you happen to get over to Tippit's
place on the way home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I was on the corner of Zangs and Colorado on my way to my
mother's and dad's house at that particular time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why were you going to change your clothes at your mother's
and dad's house? Did you live at your mother's and dad's house at that particular
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes. I did for about that 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was your mother's and dad's house from the place that
you had dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. It is quite a ways. It is about 3 or 4 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you go from where you had your lunch or dinner to
your mother's and dad's house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Straight out north on Hampton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. North on Hampton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were living in your mother's and dad's house at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. I slept there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, was your wife living there also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you separated from her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. No.</p>

<p>(To reporter: Don't put that in there.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you separated at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. At that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything else that you think that you could tell as a
result of your experiences on the 22d, 23d, or 24th, or any other time that would
be helpful to us, either in the investigation of the assassination of President
Kennedy, or the murder of Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. You mean Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Croy</span>. None that I know of. That is as well as I can remember it of what
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="WJC">TESTIMONY OF WILBUR JAY CUTCHSHAW</h2>

<p>The testimony of Wilbur Jay Cutchshaw was taken at 10:30 a.m., on March 26,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me state for the record again. My name is Burt Griffin.
I am a member of the advisory staff of the general counsel's office of the President's
Commission on the assassination of President Kennedy. This Commission
was established as a result of an Executive order that was signed by President
Johnson on November 29, 1963, and a joint resolution of Congress No. 137.
Pursuant to that joint resolution and the Executive order the Commission has
prescribed a set of procedures, and in accordance with this provision I have
been authorized to take your deposition, Mr. Cutchshaw.</p>

<p>I want to tell you first of all a little bit about the scope of the investigation.
The Commission has been directed by the President to inquire into and ascertain
all the facts that have to do with the assassination of President Kennedy
and with the subsequent murder of Lee Harvey Oswald, and to evaluate these
facts and report back to the President.</p>

<p>We don't have any authority here to prosecute any crimes. We are not
investigating for that purpose. The only crime that can be committed in connection
with this investigation is the crime of perjury. We are here to try to
determine the facts, and in order to make sure that the events that have transpired
over the last few months will not be repeated in the future, if that is
possible, and to attempt to determine whether there is still any danger to our
chief officers in Government and the national security.</p>

<p>In doing this, we have had hundreds of interviews conducted by various
members of the Federal investigatory agencies, and perhaps hundreds is an
understatement. It may be thousands. We have a stack of documents over
in a corner that would frighten you. It just represents people who have been
talked to by the various Federal Bureaus. Now we are undertaking to talk
to a few other people that we think are particularly central in terms of having
information that would be useful.</p>

<p>As to you, Mr. Cutchshaw, we have asked you to come here because we want
to ascertain what you know in particular about the death of Oswald, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
also, however, want any pertinent facts that you may have that would bear
upon the entire picture.</p>

<p>You have been asked to appear here as a result of a letter which was mailed
to Chief Curry in the form of a general request from Mr. J. Lee Rankin, who is
the general counsel of the President's Commission. Actually, under the rules
adopted by the Commission you are entitled to get a personal letter from the
Commission, and 3 days before you testify here. However, the rules do provide
that you can waive that particular letter, or 3-day written notice. Now, the
first thing I want to ask you is if you would like us to send you a letter, or if
you prefer to waive the 3-day notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I will waive that notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Also, the rules of the Commission provide that you are entitled
to be represented by counsel at any time, and many of the people do have
attorneys here. I want you to feel that we welcome your availing yourself
of this opportunity if you want to, but I see that you are not here with an
attorney, and I presume by that fact that you have decided that you don't
want one. But if you do feel that you would like one, please feel free to indicate
right now and we will <span class="locked">certainly&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't feel I need one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay, let me ask you to raise your right hand and swear you in.
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you state your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Wilbur Jay Cutchshaw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When were you born, Mr. Cutchshaw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. May 27, 1923.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you presently live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. 401 Southwest 22d, Grand Prairie, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Police officer, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been with the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. A little over 9 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you in any particular bureau of the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Criminal investigation division, juvenile bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you hold any particular rank in the department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Detective.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been with the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. About 2½ years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you the time before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Radio patrol. Mostly working in the West Dallas area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever work in the downtown Dallas area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I think I worked downtown there for about a month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Jack Ruby before the time he shot Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I had seen him one time before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. At the Carousel on Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I went up in his place one night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long was that before he shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. That's been about 2½ years ago, the first time I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark for the purpose of identification a copy
of an interview report prepared by FBI Agents Mabey and Hughes, purporting
to report an interview they had with you on December 2, 1963. I am marking
this "Dallas, Tex., Detective Cutchshaw, 3-26-64, Exhibit 5042." I have marked
for identification the interview report of December 2, 1963, by Mabey and
Hughes as Exhibit 5042. I have marked what purports to be a copy of a letter
signed by you to Chief Curry, dated November 24, 1963, as Exhibit 5043. And
I have marked as Exhibit 5044 a copy of a report by FBI Agent James W.
Bookhout, relating to an interview that Bookhout had with you on November
24th. That is Exhibit 5044. Now, have you had a chance to look over
these two interview reports and a copy of your letter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any additions or corrections that you would want
to make in those documents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I couldn't see any that I would want to make.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay; now, you were up in the juvenile bureau all of Sunday
morning until you were called down in the basement; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, during the period that you were up there, do you recall
who was on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, let's see. Officer Goolsby was working the desk, and
Lowery and myself and Harrison and Miller, I believe it was, and, oh, yes,
June McLine, a policewoman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you recall when it was that you first had any information
that Lee Oswald might be moved to the county jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. All I can remember is that Chief Stevenson came up and
told us he wanted us all to stay up in the office, and at that time it was about
9 o'clock, I believe it was. And he said that they had to form a security when
they moved Oswald, but as far as knowing exactly what time, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you place it? What makes you say that he came up
about 9 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Because I remember that he said we had to be there between,
I believe it was, 9 and 10, and so I looked out the window at the clock, but I
didn't have my watch, because I had these trousers that didn't have a watch
pocket, because I have a pocket watch. I don't have a wrist watch, and out
the window we have a sign that has a big clock. I said I better call the boys from
the cafe.</p>

<p>They had already left to go to the cafe, but it was about 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Blackie Harrison and L.&nbsp;D. Miller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you say that to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I believe I asked Captain Martin if he wanted me to call
and tell them to come back. He said tell them to get back as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you call over at the cafe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I asked somebody what the number was, and I think it was
a man on the desk, but it was Goolsby was the one that made the call. I am
not sure as to whether he did or not. I know somebody had to look it up in
the book what the number was over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don't recall whether you made the telephone call or Goolsby
made it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where it was you called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I know where they went. I say I think I do. The Deluxe
Diner, right across from the library on Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Because that is where they said they were going. That is
what we call the "greasy spoon."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you talked to Miller and Harrison about their testimony
before the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you on duty yesterday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What duty hours are you working now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I work from 8 to 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What are your days off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what happened? Do you recall Harrison and
Miller coming back from the diner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; I know the next time I saw them they were down in
the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall anybody coming in and directing you to go down
to the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Captain O.&nbsp;A. Jones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time would you estimate that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, I believe that was just before 11 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you fix the time at 11 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, I know we weren't down there too long, and when they
brought Oswald and he was shot, I think it was a little after 11, or 20 minutes
after, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who all went downstairs with you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I think it was Detective Goolsby, R.&nbsp;L. Lowery, and myself,
and I don't remember who else went down. I know we three were together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what happened when you got out of the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes; we walked into this little hallway lobby deal right in
front of the jail office, and we had to wait there for a while. They had an
officer on guard there at the entrance to the hallway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who that officer was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you left the jail office, who was it you said went
down with you? Goolsby, Lowery, and who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. That is the only two, is Officer Goolsby, Lowery, and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where Miller and Harrison were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; I don't. I did see them after that. He came in there,
and I asked him where he had been, and he said when he came back from the cafe
he went down in the basement, which is our locker room, to get some cigars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Down in the lobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, then, when you congregated outside that jail office, what
happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Captain Jones came in and told us that we were going to have
to form a cordon and keep everybody out except those who are authorized, which
was the police officers and the news media.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you anything about what you should do when Oswald
came down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. He said to try to keep everybody back and not to let them get
too close to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You formed along one of the walls; didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I was at the door where the doors come out of the jail lobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Maybe it would be easier if you took this diagram and indicate
on the diagram where. Would it be easier to turn it around the other way?
Indicate where you were. [Diagram marked Cutchshaw Exhibit No. 5046.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. This door is a swinging door, and it was swinging back inside
the jail, and I was right here at this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you put an "X" there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I was standing right here by the side of the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right; now, did you remain there the entire time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes; until after the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did Captain Jones tell you to do at that particular
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Captain Jones told us what he wanted done, for us to line up
the cordons here and block off the doors here, and had officers lined over here,
so I just got at that position. He didn't put us at any particular position. So I
was over here. And there was a bunch of newsmen in this area in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. In the jail office. And I asked him about those and he said
he wanted everybody out there, and we cleared out the jail office except the
officers here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is behind the desk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you cleared out those news people in the jail office, did
anybody help you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes; Captain Jones was there. He was right there, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
came in with me, and I believe it was a, I think it was Lieutenant Wiggins that
was on duty that morning. I'm not too sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many newspaper people would you estimate were in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I would say there were about seven or eight in there at the
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see where those people went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes; they came out this door and to the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The door where you stationed yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they all go out and turn left as they got out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. They all turned to the left, and two of them, I don't know
who they were, I would recognize them if I say them, came into this area here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Came behind the double doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Came back in from the double doors in front of the jail office
window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you put an "X" on the map where the people were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I wouldn't know the exact position where they went, but two
of them went in here, and one came back out here and stood for a minute. I
will put it right in front of this window right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. One of them went in there and stayed, and the other one went
in and came out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right; he came out and was standing out here for a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did he go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. We made him get back of the hallway, and I think I was right
about in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you put an "N" where that newspaper man was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did the remainder of the newspaper people go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. They went back into this area along there. They got a pipe
rail here, and they had officers along, and somewhere in behind these offices along
that rail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, would you place on the map where you recall seeing TV
cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Put an "N" or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't you draw sort of a rectangle of some sort and write
TV. Make it big enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. [Complies.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were there any other TV cameras in the basement, that you
recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Not right at first, but another one did come in through the
door and went down to this position here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you mark this spot that it went to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. The last position I saw it in was about in here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before Oswald came down did that TV camera come
out through the double doors and go down to the spot that you have marked in
the entrance to the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Oh, about 2 or 3 minutes. Just prior to when they were
coming down. It is when they were coming down. It is when they came
through the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at any time while you were down there, was there a TV
camera along the wall that Lowery was on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. This one right here that came through here, and Lowery was
standing right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Put an "L" where Lowery was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. And they came through right down by him, down this ramp
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there ever a TV camera stationed there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Not that I remember; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if the TV camera which you saw go out into the
garage area, came down through the public elevators, or through the jail office
elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I didn't see them come down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he come through the double doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. He came through the double doors here, and the service elevator,
public elevators over here. They came through here. As far as where
they came in, they didn't come out of the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you clear the newspaper people out of the jail office before
or after this TV camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. It was before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After the TV camera came down, where did you station yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I was right back in this door, the same place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Still there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you look out towards the TV cameras from time to time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, tell us what you saw as you looked out towards the TV
cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Mostly saw lights. I mostly saw lights were shining in my
eyes here, but there was a line of men along here which consisted of officers and
news media.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you remember when the armored car came down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, I know when they were trying to back it down, but it
couldn't get through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you remember Chief Batchelor being up there by the
armored car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I couldn't see the armored car from where I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain in this position that you have marked
with an "X" after the TV camera came through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. You mean how long did I stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Until after the officers and Lee Oswald came through. Then
I stepped up maybe one or two steps behind them, and that is when the shot
rang out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see any of the officers here in this area along the Main
Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, I think there was one standing right here, and one right
here. But just who they were, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see any of them up further across the Main Street
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't remember seeing any. I know there was a line of
men along there, and who they were, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From where you were standing, you could see the TV camera
going in that direction, couldn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I saw the TV camera over here; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you see from where you were standing any people in
front of that TV camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; not that I can remember except there were people right
in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you indicate where you saw people congregating over
in the area of the entrance to the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; I think there were some&mdash;I will put a couple of "X's"&mdash;I
think there were some along there, and there were people right along here
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were you able to see how many lines of people there were
along across the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Rio Pierce, the same Pierce car go up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see it break through the line of newsmen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes. Did I see a car break through the line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. All I know, it went up, or when it cleared the way, I know the
car did go up, because I don't know how many <span class="locked">people&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn't actually see the car reach the top of the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you lose sight of that car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. When it went up past this line here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On November 24, the day that Oswald was shot, you prepared
a letter to Chief Curry, and you were also interviewed by Agent Bookhout.
Do you remember those two things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember whether you prepared your letter to Curry
before or after you were interviewed by Bookhout?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. It was before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, after the shooting, did you go back into the
jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You followed Ruby and Oswald back in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, I helped carry&mdash;I had hold of Ruby's left hand up as
far as the jail office door. And all of us couldn't get through at the same time, so
I released, because there was another man right in front at his shoulder, so I
let go so they could get in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you in the jail office when Ruby was taken upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, I think I was, because I was there at the door keeping
other people out&mdash;after I got in. Let me put it like this: After we got
Ruby on the inside, I slammed the door, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did there come a time when you left the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long after Ruby shot Oswald would you say that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I imagine it was only a couple of minutes. Just a very short
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I notified this TV camera officer here with two men, I went
over to talk to them, because they were trying to push it up this ramp by theirselves,
and I do remember seeing three men with that camera at one time, and
there was only two men at the time trying to push it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what TV camera that was? What station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Channel 5 on the camera box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you subsequently learned that it was a Dallas channel 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, I think so, that channel 5. I believe it is a Fort Worth
station. It is one of them, got two of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What channel is channel 5? What station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I believe that is a Fort Worth station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What are the call letters on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Man, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it in your statement anywhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't know. I don't think I know the call letters. Just
channel 5 is the only thing I saw on the box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many men were over at the camera at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. When I was standing at the door, I had it closed, and I
looked out and I saw the camera here with only two men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did you go over to the camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Because I remember three men being with the camera in
this area here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Did you have reason to think one of them might be Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I didn't at the time, because I figured if there were three
men pushing it out, why wouldn't there be three men trying to get it up the
ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many did you see get it up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you detain those men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anybody assist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Officer Lowery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anybody else?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Not at the time, because we finally got Lieutenant Swain
over there and he talked with them awhile, and at that time when he and
Lowery had them, or Swain talked to them, we got their names where we would
be able to ask information of them later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was the first one of the two of you to arrive at the TV
cameras? Was it Lowery or was he there when you came up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much later did Lowery come up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. When I got over there and this one, I don't know what the
names are, I think this one that had the coat on was Alexander, as well as I
can remember. He was kind of nervous and shaky. So, then I called Lowery
to help me out, because I didn't know whether they might be involved or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember where Lowery was standing when you called
him over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I believe he was right over in this area. I am not too sure,
but I think he was, because I could see him from here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The point you are talking about is in front of the double doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Between the double doors and the driveway close to, I call
that the north wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at the time Lowery arrived, was Lieutenant Swain there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much longer would you say after Lowery arrived did
Lieutenant Swain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, in the process after I got Lowery over there and we were
holding them, we tried to stop two or three officers prior to that, supervisory
officers, and they were in a hustle trying to get around, and they finally got
Swain, and I think it was maybe 5 or 6 minutes after Lowery got there, and
they got Lieutenant Swain to come over and talk to them. Not to talk, but for
us to have a conference as to what to do about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how long did you talk with Lieutenant Swain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, I imagine it was about 3 or 4 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you and Lowery turn the two TV men over to Lieutenant
Swain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. When I got the names and everything, Lowery started getting
their names and I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Lowery take the names down in a notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. He took the names and he turned them over to the homicide
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You left, and where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I came back upstairs to my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Room 314.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do when you got up to the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I waited up there until further information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you wait?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Man, I don't know. We was up there for quite a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you eventually go out to Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, before you went out to Love Field, did you prepare a
report of what had happened down in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No, sir; that is where I went, I am sorry. I am getting confused,
but when I left the basement, I talked to somebody downstairs about it,
and I think that was Captain Jones, and he said, "Well, go upstairs and write
out your report, whatever you know, or what you saw." And I went to the
homicide bureau first and made out my report in written letter form that you
have, and gave it to the homicide office up there, and then I went to my room,
which is room 314.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, so at the time you prepared this letter dated&mdash;let me
ask you this: Let me hand you Exhibit 5043. Is that a true and accurate
copy of a report that you wrote out in the homicide bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Let me take a minute here [reading report]. You mean
word for word?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this: I notice you pulled out a set of papers from
your pocket. You have a copy of the actual report you prepared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes; I have a copy which is one of the Xerox copies of the
report which I wrote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you mind if we made a photocopy of that? And retain
it for our files?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No, sir; I don't. In fact, it looks like&mdash;that is my handwritten
copy. I don't know whether you can read it or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I think I can make out your handwriting here. I am
referring now to the copy of the handwritten report which Detective Crenshaw
prepared on November 24, 1963, in the homicide bureau office. Approximately
how long after Ruby shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. About 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could it have been longer than that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. It could have been longer, but it was approximately 20
minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could it have been as long as 2 hours later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I think it was that long. It might have been the way things
were, but I remember when I left the basement, I did go upstairs, and I did
go to the homicide office and that is where I wrote the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go up to homicide because somebody in the basement
told you to go up and write a report on what you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Captain Jones. I know he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. And there was a standing order to put it down in writing
what you saw and what you did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this after everything had been quieted down in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes; well, now, I am losing track of my time again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is important that we try to straighten this out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Let's see. I will have to retract some of them. I don't
want to state it that way. But so far as what I have said, it is true, but as
far as my time element is concerned, when I left, I had to go up to the first
floor, and I kept seeing people coming in and out.</p>

<p>We have three entrances. The Harwood, Main and Commerce, and I think
there was four of us which were taking names of people coming in and leaving,
and checking their identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which entrance was it you were at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I was checking the Commerce side. I was inside the building
close to the information desk, but checking those coming in and leaving
the Commerce Street entrance to the building. So it might have been about
2 hours after, because I know I was down there for quite awhile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you were at the Commerce Street side, were you at the
door going out of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; I was in the hallway close to the entrance of the hallway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you said before, closer to the information desk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Closer to the information where the hallway is in front of
the desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is on the first floor and not in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right. It is on the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who was up there with you taking names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Lowery there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Harrison there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't think he was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anybody from the juvenile bureau there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I was the only one from the juvenile. There was about four
or five officers, two at the desk and one at the Harwood side there, checking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
those, and one on the other side of the desk checking those coming from the
Main Street, and I was on Commerce Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you tell any of the people up there what you had seen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; not that I can remember. You mean what I saw down
in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; about your suspicion about those guys pushing the camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were you taken off that duty by anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes. Lieutenant came down and told us it was all right to
secure, that everything was settled down, and that is when I left and went up
to the homicide office and wrote my report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you get the instructions to write a report on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Down in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before you got stationed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Before I had to go upstairs: yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at the time Captain Jones gave you those instructions
down there, had the basement sort of quieted down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he give instructions to a bunch of you standing in a group,
or were you all spread out, or how did it happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I think there were two or three of us there, and I asked about
it, and told him, and he said, "The information is good," but he said, "Put it
down in writing so you will be able to refer to it later."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who else was there at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't remember who all was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, now, on the basis of what you told us, what would be your
best estimate of how long it was after you saw this cameraman come through
that you wrote this report? And when I say on the basis of what you said,
I don't mean that I want you to conform to anything you have said, but taking
into account all the discussion we have had now, what is your best judgment
as to how long it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. About an hour and a half or 2 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you took the names of the two men you found at
the <span class="locked">camera&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I didn't take the names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Lowery took those names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How were those two men dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. One of them had on a long black coat. One of these kind of,
like a raincoat&mdash;topcoat combination deal, and the other one, best I can remember,
had on a greenish shirt and khaki trousers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where had those two men, as you recall, where had they been
on the camera as it was being pushed through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. You mean where? How were they positioned there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was the man in the black coat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. The man in the black coat was on the left side of the camera,
and the other one was on the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There was one man in between?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. As far as I can remember, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you discuss that man with those people that you and
Lowery confronted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. You mean the two men at the camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ask them where the third man was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I asked them where the third man was who had helped them
with the camera, and they told me they didn't know there was any third man
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ask those men where that camera had been before it
came through the double doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you subsequently learned where it was before it came
through the double doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes. I heard it had been up on the third floor, and that they
were bringing it down because it had the telescopic lens, and they were wanting
to get a shot taking Oswald up the ramp to the armored car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you learn the names of the two men that you talked with
out at that camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I have not since then, no. At the time, I thought one was
named John Alexander, but I don't know what their names are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Lowery saw you questioning those two men, do you
recall if Lowery at that time remembered that there had been a third man on
the camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, when I called him over there, I told him what I had,
and he said, "Yes, he remembered a third man being with them."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But Lowery came over at your beckoning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Lowery did not come over spontaneously?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you arrived up in the homicide office to write your report,
who was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Lowery was there, and there was some officers from the homicide
bureau there, and Captain Fritz was in his office, and I think there was a
Secret Service man there with him. I don't know what his name was. I was
told it was a Secret Service man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know L.&nbsp;D. Montgomery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. You mean the detective?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether he was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't recall whether he was or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Blackie Harrison there when you arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I think he was there in the office. I believe he was in there,
and there was Lieutenant Wallace. I just don't remember who else was there.
I know the place was full.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who else was there? Let me ask you&mdash;I want to ask you here
to speculate a little bit but at the same time to give me an honest opinion on
this.</p>

<p>You have had a chance to talk with many police officers, I presume, about all
the events that took place, and you know of all the rumors that there have
been about the man walking down the Main Street ramp and so forth and so on.</p>

<p>Do you still feel&mdash;can you tell me whether or not you still have a belief that
Jack Ruby might have been the man who pushed that camera in, in your own
mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, in my own mind, I can tell you this: I did see the third
man with the camera, and it struck me so strange that only two men&mdash;there
were three men, but still only two were trying to push the camera, and that is
the reason I went out and contacted the two men.</p>

<p>Let me tell you, I did learn from Lieutenant Wallace&mdash;that is one of the
investigators on the thing for the city&mdash;one of you might have talked with
him&mdash;that you contacted the crews on this camera&mdash;and he did say that a man
that was with these cameras over here that at about&mdash;see, there is a slight
decline in this area right here where Lowery was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There was a decline where Lowery was standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. At the time that that camera was being pushed, a man came
from this crew over here and helped them push it on down. If there is where
I got the three men, but I do remember seeing three men on that camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And, in other words, somebody came over to the two-man crew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Off one of these cameras here. Channel 5 already had one
camera down here, but they said&mdash;that is where I got the reason for this&mdash;they
brought the wide angle lens and they wanted one of the telescopic lens to get
a shot of him walking up the ramp to where the armored car was. But still I
did see three men pushing that camera through here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let's put this on the record. Now, as I understand the story that
you heard was that a man came from the two TV cameras, from the channel 5
camera that was already stationed behind a railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And came off and assisted two other men who had already been
pushing that camera through the door, and that man reached the camera at
approximately when that camera was near Lowery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. That is what I was told, what I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, if that were true, do you think as you look at&mdash;out in the
area toward where Lowery and that camera would have been at that point,
that you would have seen a man walk over there to that camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. If I had been looking there at that time, I could have; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, what I am getting at is, the area that was in
front of those two stationery TV cameras was clear, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes; because the cameras and lights were right here. And
they had lights up here shining in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Now, the camera came this route here through these swinging
doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see it come through the swinging doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes; I saw it coming through the swinging doors because
these doors came open and they come through, and I was standing right here. I
wasn't right exactly at the corner door, but I was in the doorway at the time.</p>

<p>I held one of the doors open when they came through, and the camera came
right on down here and was parked in this area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are indicating on the chart that it was pushed through the
swinging doors where Lowery was stationed and over to the point that you have
marked it as the final resting place in the garage entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. That is where I saw it; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have also been told that this same channel 5 had some other
new camera behind the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, in front of that railing, was that area in front of the railing
clear of people at the time that that camera came through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't remember whether it was exactly clear or not. I
know that right after the camera came through, that these men down here started
hollering to everyone to clear back. Evidently some were standing in front of
the cameras down there and that is why they had to clear them out.</p>

<p>So far as I remember, most of the people were standing here, and in front of
the door, and on the south side of the hallway into the ramp, and on the north
side of the hallway, and into the ramp there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, this guy you say had on a dark suit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if he had on a hat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I do not, because the man I saw was bent over pushing like
that [indicating]. All three is what struck me strange that all three of them,
not one was putting all his weight, but all three were bent over pushing like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time that you ran for those TV cameras after the shooting,
did you know that Jack Ruby had been the person who shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I knew that. I helped carry the man through the jail office
doors to the jail office, and while I was there standing guard on the doors, someone
said who is he, and a guy said it is Jack Ruby. And I was standing in the
door when a doctor came in right after we got Ruby in there and they brought
Oswald, and immediately thereafter, someone was banging on the door trying
to get through, and I tried to push him out, and he said he was a doctor, and
that he had been called. And I run my hand down his side and he had the
stethoscope in his right hand coat pocket, and I let him through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, by the time you ran to the TV cameras, you knew that Ruby
was the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I knew that Ruby was the man. They said he was Jack
Ruby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, if you had seen the third man after it reached, or as it
reached Lowery, do you think you would have seen that man move from the TV
cameras to the channel 5 camera that was stationed behind the railing? Do you
think you would have seen him move from there to the position of the camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, let me put it this way: I didn't just watch this camera
all the way through, because it done past this point, and the next time I saw it,
I remember seeing it when I was looking through the square glass in the door
when I was holding it to, and I saw the two men push it up here.</p>

<p>So, I don't know whether I was looking at the camera at the time I was down
here, but I didn't see anyone go around to the camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time that the TV camera came through the door, the double
doors, you were looking through another glass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; now at the time it came through the door, this door was
being opened from the inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This single door that entered into the jail office opened inward
toward the jail office, and it didn't obstruct your view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; they came through the swinging door. I was standing in
the doorway and I held this door open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You held open the swinging doors for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right; when they came through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You pulled it back toward yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. They were already going past, and I grabbed ahold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, the swinging doors were between you, your face and them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; I was standing at the edge of this swinging door holding
it back for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, you were behind the swinging doors when you were holding
the end of the swinging door, and you were off to the side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there was nothing on part of that door which was between
you and them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How far away would you say you were from those men at that
point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. About 3 feet. Maybe 2, or I could have reached out and put
my hand on one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you see the faces of those men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. The one on the left, the one that had on a black coat, when
he came through, he looked up like that and he was pushing on through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you ultimately met over there, you confronted those men
afterward and saw the man in the black coat, was it the same man that turned
up and looked at you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there any question in your mind about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; I remember his nose real good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after those men passed you, did you let the doors swing
back, or did you walk back with it, or what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I just turned loose of it. There was another officer that
closed right in behind them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There were other officers that closed in behind the TV cameramen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did those officers go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. They just stood there. There were some standing in front
of the door at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you didn't follow them through the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No. They were already stationed there, and then when they
started pushing through, the doors came open, and the officers just moved aside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As that door swung shut, do you recall whether you then looked
back up the hallway from which that camera had come to see if other people
were coming down, or whether you might have looked in toward the jail office,
or whether you continued to watch them go on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any activity back here in that hallway immediately
after you let go of that swinging door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, just a little, maybe a minute or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But not immediately thereafter? Do you have any recollection
of seeing anything back there immediately thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, right after, right after this, the doors came to here, a
man stepped away from the wall over there, the one I told you previously where
one came into the hallway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A newspaperman? A newspaper person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Stepped away from this area where you have the "N" marked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did he walk to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. He walked out toward the swinging doors and motioned for
somebody to come out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And your attention was attracted to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you actually see that man move away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes. Who moved away from right here and stepped about
half way from where he was standing up to the swinging doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Have you watched the movies of all this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I just seen it one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Are you able to state whether what you are telling
us now is from your own knowledge, or is it confused with anything you may
have seen in the movies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Because I remember when he stepped out, I made him get
back, and I told him to get back up against the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether you were looking in his direction when
he did this, or whether your attention was attracted to him and then you had to
look at him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I think I was looking in the hallway in this area here when
he stepped out, and he stepped, there was only about two steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say in this area here. You mean you were looking in
the direction of Lowery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes, in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. She can't write that. I am going to have to explain for the
record.</p>

<p>Were you looking in the direction of Lowery, or in the direction of the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, in the direction of the TV camera which was being
pushed out at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That man walked out, and you got out to motion somebody in, and
you pushed him back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I told him to get back up against the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At that point do you believe that if somebody had walked out
from the channel 5 camera that was already in place behind the railing, are you
able to state whether or not you would have seen him get in position and help
push that other camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, that is kind of hard to say, because when I looked out
here and he stepped out there, and I told him to get back, I don't know whether
I would notice anybody at that camera, because my attention at this time was
at the man that stepped away from the hallway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. However, whatever struck your attention to the general placement
of the people in front of those TV cameras, do you recall whether there
were people in front of the TV cameras at any time before you saw this other
TV camera come out of the hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Whether they were exactly in front of the TV cameras, I
don't know, but I know there was lots of people along this north wall and in
the driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are not indicating anything that is directly in front of the
TV camera?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, shortly after this camera came through, someone hollered,
"Here they come," or else I think I forget, or "They are on their way
down"&mdash;we have lights on the basement showing where the elevator is coming
down, and someone hollered to clear the way for the cameras&mdash;to get out from in
front of the cameras&mdash;but as far as me telling how many people were in front
of the cameras, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you ever talked to Lowery about whether he saw some
man come from the channel 5 stationary camera and help push the moving
camera into that space?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Now, Lowery and I were talking when Lieutenant Wallace
told us&mdash;he said, if I remember right, Wallace, he says, "I believe I think I found
out where you got the third man." And we asked him where, and he said he
found out from the crew that a man came from the other channel 5 camera that
was already in the basement and helped them down this short incline, because
the camera was rocking.</p>

<p>And I said, "I don't remember anybody, but I do remember seeing three men
on the camera." And, Lowery said the same thing, that he did remember seeing
the three men. But I don't remember anybody coming from here to the camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let's go ahead now, sir. When you were up there filling out your
report in the homicide office&mdash;when you talked with these men that you finally
detained after the shooting, the two men that you detained, did you describe
to them the third man that was with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you asked them where is the third man and he said there
wasn't, what did they say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. They just told me that there wasn't any, that if there was a
third man there, they didn't know about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was anybody else standing with you at the time they said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I believe Officer Lowery was there at that time. But the first
thing, I went right out there and got a hold of both of them and asked them,
"Where is the other man that came out with them." And he said, "There
wasn't any other man." And I said, "I know there were three men with you
when you came out." And he said, "If there was one between us, they don't
know nothing about it." And I don't remember whether Officer Lowery was
there, but I don't think he was there, but we did question them again, and I
still think there was a third man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Officer Swain, did he make that denial to Swain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't really know, because that is when I left and had to go
up to the first floor. Lowery started getting their names and they talked to
Lieutenant Swain and told them what it was, and he said, "Go ahead and get
their names and ask where they are going to be."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was it that came up to you and told you that he had found
out, had an explanation for the third man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Lieutenant Wallace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long was that after Sunday, November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I imagine that was maybe a week or two, because through
their investigation they tried to contact everybody that was down there. It
was quite some time. The exact amount of days, I don't know, but it was quite
some time after that he explained it to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got up to the homicide office, did Lowery fill out a
report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Harrison fill out a report while you were out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I think he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you all talk about this when you were up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes; I believe we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it that you were all&mdash;as a matter of fact, this was probably
a matter of general interest to everybody up there, don't you imagine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You think anybody could have been in that office without knowing
what you guys had seen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I think so, because we don't tell everybody up there in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
office. Of course, at the time we wrote out a report, I think there was me,
Lowery, and I believe Harrison did come back and start writing out his, and
I think Lieutenant Wallace, and he said put down what you saw and what you
know only, and that is the way I wrote out my report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mentioned the guys you were talking with about it, so
anybody other than you and Lowery who might have been there could have
heard it and might have told it to somebody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Possibly; yes. But we didn't talk a whole lot while we were
writing the report. We just sat down and wrote it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about after you wrote the report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes. We went back to our office and shot the bull and gabbed
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And speculated about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did other people come in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about other members of the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Officer Goolsby there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. In the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Martin there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes; he was out there quite a bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Miller there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you think of anybody else who was in that office after
you had written out your report and were talking about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, let's see. There was a reporter up there. You mean so
far as officers is concerned, or just anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Give me just the officers first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I believe June McLine, and then I believe that covered all the
officers and myself and Harrison and Miller, and Goolsby, and McLine, and
then there were other officers, I know, but I don't know who all they were.
I don't remember. And they had that one little reporter from up north somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. One of those Yankee reporters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Like Cleveland, Ohio, maybe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't know where he was from, but I didn't like him very
much. Then there was a French reporter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A French reporter was up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you seen that French reporter when you were down in
the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I think so. I'm not going to swear, because there were so
darn many of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you seen that French reporter there before this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes; because he and some other reporters from up North,
they kind of made our office their office, you might say. That was their base
of operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did that French reporter tell you? Did he see that TV
camera come through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I didn't talk to him about it or ask him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did any of the people who were up there in the office indicate
they had also seen the TV camera come through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I think Goolsby said he saw the camera come through but
he didn't remember anything about who was pushing it or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you view the TV film with these men coming through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From your recollection of that TV film, could you see the third
man on the camera pushing it through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; the only two I could see was just the two that I gave
a description. It was one on the right that had, I think, the greenish-type
shirt, and the one on the left that had the black coat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Try to remember that TV film. Did that TV film which you
saw, did that show the camera as it came through the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did it show the man looking up at you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't remember whether it did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is the camera shot taken from such a position that if there
had been a third man behind the camera, it would have showed up on the
TV picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Now, the camera shot on this one that was coming up on the
door was a straight-on shot, and whether they would show up, I didn't see
any other man. If he had been there, he would be directly behind the stand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall how far that TV picture of the men coming out
of the swinging doors follows the camera as it proceeds through the swinging
doors? Out past Lowery? Does it show Lowery up on the TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't remember whether it does or not, because at the time
I saw the film, I was just looking at the camera to see whether I could see
anybody behind it or not. The way the picture was on the film, it shows the
camera coming out, and it was passing out of range of the TV camera that was
taking the pictures at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how soon after Oswald was shot did you view those
TV films?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it before or after Lieutenant Wallace reported to you
that he could solve the problem of the third man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I believe it was after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You saw the film after you talked to Wallace?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall in looking at those TV films whether you show
up in the TV film?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. On one of the films I do, but whether it was on the TV or
one of the camera pictures, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, on the films that you watched, do you recall whether
those films show you looking at the men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Like I say, I don't even remember seeing them. You know,
one showed me, but I think I was looking almost straight out at an angle from
the door where I was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In any other films which you have seen, is there depicted
the episode where the newsmen moved out from the position that you have
marked with an "N" on the north wall of the entranceway to between the jail
office and the ramp? Does it show that man coming out and your motioning
him back as you have described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am asking you these questions because I am trying to get
you to refresh your recollection even more.</p>

<p>Now, Detective Cutchshaw, we all know that shortly after Ruby shot Oswald,
a certain amount of heat was focused on Blackie Harrison. You are aware
of that, aren't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I want you to tell me honestly&mdash;I think you have tried
to be strictly forthright to me in describing this camera.</p>

<p>Do you think that your concern about Harrison in any way has affected
what you remembered about this event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Didn't Harrison indicate shortly after this event that he was
worried about this, because Ruby had come right past him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Didn't he talk about that by the time you got back to the
juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I don't remember whether he talked about it; he just said
that he remembered seeing this man come out and this gun come up, and he
described to me, but as far as him saying he was worried about it, I don't
remember that. As far as any reflection on <span class="locked">himself&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I was not trying to talk particularly about whether Blackie
saw Jack there a few minutes ago. Honestly, I don't care to know if that is
true, but to me, that is no reflection on him. But it is very important for us
to find out what happened, because if we don't know what happened, we have
to speculate and wonder whether there was somebody else involved here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, let me tell you: I came down here. A lot of people say
I need a lawyer, but I don't want one because I came down to tell you the truth
and just the way I saw it. I told you what I saw. Of course, some of my
time elements are a little bit this way, but I said what I saw, and the only
thing I did tell <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want you to tell me, and this is what is important, what you
feel at this point, what your motivation, unconscious or conscious, is in this,
and I don't expect you to tell me that Blackie thought that he saw the man or
anybody else, but I want to know if you feel that what you have told me today
in such a determined and what appeared to me forthright fashion, is based, is
affected in any way because of the concern of anybody in the juvenile bureau,
about Harrison and Lowery and Miller and anybody else in the bureau who
was down there, and in particular to have seen Ruby if he came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I believe that if Blackie Harrison had seen Ruby come in, he
would have put him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, to what extent, I want to know, do you think that this concern
of your affects your story, honestly?</p>

<p>I could tell this story and honestly believe everything I am telling, but yet
we all know unconsciously our emotions are affected.</p>

<p>How much are you being affected by that concern of Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. None of my story or anything I have told you has been affected
in any way for any concern for any one person in the department.</p>

<p>I came down here to tell you this, and everything is just the way I saw it.
And as far as concern for any one individual, I don't have any.</p>

<p>Now, Blackie is a friend of mine, and I have known him for a long time. I
have no concern for him, because I don't think he did anything wrong. And I
think if he had seen the man, he would have put him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Even if he had seen and hadn't put him out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Even if he had seen and hadn't put him out, then he did the
wrong thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you think he would have been disciplined for that, too,
don't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I believe he would be disciplined for that, too, and he would
be, if he had seen the man and hadn't put him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you think that if Blackie knew that he wouldn't be disciplined
for this, and if somebody were to tell him now that he wouldn't be
disciplined and it wouldn't be made known to anybody in the public or even
anybody in the police department, and it actually turned out Blackie did see
this guy, do you think Blackie would tell us about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I believe he would. Blackie is an honest man. In fact, the
way it is right now, if he had saw the man, I believe he would tell you he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You heard the story that Blackie had taken some sort of medicine
before he took that lie detector test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You haven't heard that story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are concerned, I take it, about the department, though you
said you are not concerned about any particular man in the department, but
you are concerned about the department?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. As far as doing anything wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, you <span class="locked">act&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. The way you are talking is that I am concerned that I think
we have done something wrong. I don't think there is one wrongdoing, as far as
the officers are concerned and what happened down there. I didn't think like
that.</p>

<p>Departmental wise or individualwise, there are things pro and con of what
should have happened and what shouldn't have happened.</p>

<p>One way of looking, there shouldn't have been any news media, and maybe
they shouldn't have been spread out that way, but we would have caught the
dickens that way.</p>

<p>And, as I heard, Chief Curry had the okay from a little higher up to go ahead
and have the news media, and it didn't turn out too good.</p>

<p>But as far as wrongdoings, there is not one wrong thing that happened as far
as our department is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Lowery? Are you much of a friend with Lowery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. We ride to work together and run around a bit together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How friendly are you with Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. We are good friends, but as far as running around, he lives
way over in Pleasant Grove, and I live in Grand Prairie. It is way across town,
so we don't get around together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Lowery had seen Ruby. Did Lowery know Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Did he recognize Ruby before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He had seen Ruby on a number of occasions, actually, didn't he
before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. You mean before this happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I tell you the truth, I really don't know. I think he said he
knew him, or seen him around, but as far as actual standing there, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Captain King in the basement at any time prior to
the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, now, that I don't remember whether I saw him down
there prior to the shooting or whether it was after. There was a whole bunch
of officers down there, and, man, I do remember a few immediately right there,
and someone that came out the door, because I was right there and watched
them as they came out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, if you and Captain King had been standing together
and you both saw Ruby and you both knew Ruby, what would you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, now, you mean if we saw him come into the basement,
or if we saw him standing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Saw him standing down there and you were both standing there
together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Well, that is something that is pretty hard to say, honestly,
because the basement is supposed to be secured when we went down there.</p>

<p>In other words, everybody that wasn't supposed to be there, was supposed to
be out, and they had officers checking them coming in, and me not knowing
Ruby, I probably wouldn't have known him if I had been shown him on the
street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you knew Ruby and you both were standing there, if you knew
him and you and Captain King were standing there, and you knew Captain
King was looking at him <span class="locked">too&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I would have tried to find out what he was doing, knowing he
wasn't a newsman or couldn't have a news pass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you have deferred to Captain King or any other superior
officer? Would you let him take the initiative on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I would have asked him myself if I had seen him, because
that is what we were down there for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am trying to get at, and the only reason I use Captain
King&mdash;I could have used Chief Batchelor or anybody like that, but my point
is, that if a junior officer like you and a senior officer were standing together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
is there any feeling that you would defer to the senior officer to take the
initiative in throwing some guy out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. If he were in charge of me or in charge of security and if I
saw Jack Ruby there and he didn't have a pass on and I knew him and knew
that he was not a news representative, then if I confronted him and he said,
"Chief Batchelor said it was okay," then I would have asked the chief if it
was all right.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I wouldn't say the chief had anything to do with it and I would
put him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, if you had seen him first, you would have gone directly to
him and then turned to your superior officer and said what shall I do about
this guy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. I would have went directly to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You would have gone directly to him. Do you think that is
true of any other officer or do you think some of them would have acted
different?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. That is hard to say, not knowing every officer's traits. Some
operate one way and some operate another.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want you to examine Cutchshaw Exhibits Nos. 5042, 5043, 5044,
5045, and 5046, and if there are no further additions or corrections to make to
those in addition to all this we have been talking about, then I would like you
to sign each one of these and date them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cutchshaw</span>. Where do you want me to sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sign it in a conspicuous place where I have placed the mark
on the paper. Sign your name and date it. Regular signature or full name.</p>

<h2 id="NJD">TESTIMONY OF NAPOLEON J. DANIELS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Napoleon J. Daniels was taken at 2:40 p.m., on April 16,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of
the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. My name is Leon Hubert, Mr. Daniels. I'm a member of the
advisory staff of the general counsel of the President's Commission under the
provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and joint resolution
of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission
in conformance with the Executive order and the joint resolution, and I have
been authorized to take the sworn deposition from you, Mr. Daniels.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission's inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate, and to report on the facts relating to the assassination of
President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mr. Daniels, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent
facts you may know about the general inquiry, and, of course, about the
entry of Jack Ruby into the basement of the police department.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Daniels, I think you have appeared here today by virtue of a written
request sent to you by mail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And signed by Mr. J. Lee Rankin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. General Counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you receive that letter more than 3 days ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes; I received it Saturday, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Last Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that this is Thursday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. It has been 3 days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you raise your right hand, stand, and take the oath, please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give in this matter will
be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. State your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Napoleon J. Daniels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Thirty-two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. 2229 Sutter [spelling] S-u-t-t-e-r.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation, Mr. Daniels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Real estate broker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so occupied?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. About 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you own your own company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were at one time connected with the police department,
were you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes; about 7 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About 7 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you leave the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I left there in November 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were the circumstances under which you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Let me see just how I can put this&mdash;well, I resigned, of course,
I was asked to resign because of some conflicts I had with a tenant living in
one of my apartments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, you rented out some property to a tenant and
you had some difficulty with the tenant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And on account of that difficulty they asked you to resign from
the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did resign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And have you continued in the business under the name N.&nbsp;J.
Daniels Real Estate Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That's right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a corporation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No; just a company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I know you have already made a statement to the FBI,
as a matter of fact, I think you have made two statements, one to the State
police&mdash;I would now just like for you to tell us what you know of entry of
Jack Ruby into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Well, actually, I don't feel like I really know anything, but I
saw a guy go in the basement, but I don't think it was Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let's start off with that morning, of course, you knew that the
President had been killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And as I understand, you were riding in your own car over
towards the place where he was killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes, I was going out Main Street. I was going&mdash;let's see,
that was Sunday morning and I was going down Main Street to look at
the spot where the President had been assassinated and as I drove by the
city hall, I noticed a bunch of people standing around and noticed this officer
standing in the entrance to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes; on Main Street, and so I made the block and turned
around and came back and parked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you park?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you park?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. On Main there, right down from the city hall there, I guess
about a half a block down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the other side of the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. On the same side of the city hall, you see, I went around and
came back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went around what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Now, that first street down, I guess that's&mdash;I was going down
Main and turned, I believe the first block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would that have been Pearl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No; you see, I was going west on Main and the first street I
could turn&mdash;I think the first street is a one way going left, but I turned and
came back the other way, so it must have been Ervay where I turned and
went up to Pacific and then come back up to Harwood and then came down
Harwood to Main and made a left on Main and parked up in a vacant space
on the other side of the city hall&mdash;on the east side of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I thought you had parked at a parking lot near the Western
Union office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No; it wasn't a parking lot. I was thinking I parked on the
street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You parked on the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it near the Western Union office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes; right down from the city hall. In other words, it was
in between there and the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you were parked on Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. On the south side of Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Not in a parking lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No; I wasn't at a parking lot, no, I think I parked on the
street, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you parked on the same side of the street as the city hall
and as the police department is and as the Western Union office is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you parked at a spot between the Western Union office
and the Main Street entrance of the city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are familiar with that building, because you worked there
for a long time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say you were about half way between the Western
Union and the Main ramp, or just what distance between those two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Oh, let me see, let me get it in my mind&mdash;I would say I was
a little nearer the Western Union Building than I was to the entrance of the
basement of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you familiar with that alley that goes from Main Street
back in towards Commerce and makes an "L" and comes out on Pearl Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I think I was just on the east side of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say "east," it doesn't mean anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Near Pearl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you were on the Western Union side of the
alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your car was facing towards the Western Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, about what time was it when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Near 11 o'clock&mdash;I wasn't paying much attention to the time,
it must have been near 11 o'clock or a little after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you fix that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Well, I'm trying to fix it at about the time Oswald was shot.
Now, I was there about 20 or 25 or 30 minutes before it happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you parked your car, did you sit in your car any length
of time at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No; I got out and walked back up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you immediately got out and walked back up to the
Main door&mdash;the Main door entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I'm going to show you a drawing, which among other
things includes the entrance to the basement, and I am marking it for the
purpose of identification as follows:</p>

<p>"Dallas, Tex., April 16, 1964, Exhibit No. 5324, Deposition of N.&nbsp;J. Daniels,"
and I am marking it with my name.</p>

<p>I would like you to study this, and I point out to you that this is Main Street,
here is the Western Union office, and here is Pearl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Over in that direction would be Harwood, Commerce is over
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the Main Street entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think you are familiar with the fact that there is a stone
fence about 2 feet high that runs from the entrance of Main Street toward the
street some distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, as I understand it, you were parked on Main Street itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Facing towards the Western Union Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. This side of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the same side of the street as the Western Union Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that you reached there at approximately 11 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes; at approximately 11 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You immediately got out of your car and you walked toward
the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you got down there, did you go past the ramp, or did you
stay on the Western Union side of the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I think when I first got there, I walked over in front of the
little entrance down in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you could look right down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. So I could look in there, because I was on the sidewalk when
I did that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Officer Vaughn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had known him from the time you were on the police force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he recognize you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you went to the middle of the ramp, but still on the sidewalk
and looked down the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you stay there very long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No; I spoke to him and he told me that he was blocking anybody's
entrance, in other words, that's what he meant, that he was blocking anybody's
entrance into the basement. That's what he was there for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was posted at that spot&mdash;where was he standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. He was standing right in the middle of the entrance there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I'm going to mark on Exhibit 5324 a position which I am
going to call "1" and I am putting a circle on it and I'm going to draw a line,
and then I'm going to put "First position of Daniels," is that about correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes, that's about correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I'm going to mark a position called "2" and I'm going to
draw a line, and I'm going to mark it "position of Vaughn when Daniels was in
position number "1", and ask you if that is correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And as you said, he recognized you and you recognized him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you looked down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I stepped back over to the bannister <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean back towards the Western Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever go on the other side of the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Towards Harwood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No&mdash;at no time&mdash;I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say you went towards the bannister, were you on the
inside of the bannister, that is to say, between the bannister and the ramp, or
on the Western Union side of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. You mean after I got back to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes; I got&mdash;I went back to it and stood on the Western Union
side and just propped my foot up on the end of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were then facing toward Harwood Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. More or less?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you move out of that position at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Well, yes; during the time I was there I moved several times,
but it was all right around in that area there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But did you ever go to the Harwood Street side of the Main
Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am going to draw it lightly first so we can get it straight&mdash;if
I draw an area like so&mdash;would it be fair to say that you were at all times that
you are going to testify to later, within that area, except when you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Now, what is this here&mdash;is this the bannister here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; this is the measuring line, this doesn't actually show the
bannister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. The bannister come right around in here&mdash;I was always right in
this area right in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, we will draw a circle like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am drawing a larger circle in which I am putting the number
"3", drawing a line out and saying "Area in which Daniels was after he left position
'1' and until shooting." Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I understand, of course, that you might have moved around
in that area, but substantially that's what it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was on the Western Union side of the little concrete or
marble ramp that comes out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you are telling me that you never did go on the Harwood
Street side thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many people were in the area you were in&mdash;this area that
we have marked No. 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Well, now, at different times there was as high as four or five&mdash;some
of them would come by and stop and then go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Let me see&mdash;about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Even though there were some people on the other side of the
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes; there was three or four on the other side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before Oswald was shot, and I think you did hear
the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before Oswald was shot did you get to position No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I would say 20 or 25 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then, how long were you in position No. 3 before he was
shot, in the area of No. 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Well, let me see&mdash;almost the same, because I had just came over
here and looked and immediately walked back over here&mdash;I would say no time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you came from your car to position 1 and took
a quick look and went to the area of No. 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you stayed there until the shot was fired, and you think
it was about 20 minutes later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember a car coming up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Lt. Rio Pierce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize him driving the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I don't remember whether he was driving or not, there were
four officers in there and he was the only one I recognized right off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There were four in there you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Two in the front and two in the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who were the others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I didn't really get a good look at them but I knew him, but
I got a better look at him than I did the rest of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he see you&mdash;did he show any signs of recognition to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before the shooting did that occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Let's see, I would say 3 or 4 minutes. Now, I have been thoroughly
confused on this because down at the police department they tell me
one thing and it gets my mind all confused.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what we want is not what somebody else told you, but
what you, yourself can best remember today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Here's what struck me&mdash;when I saw the car come out, I was
thinking&mdash;I guess they are fixing to bring Oswald out now, maybe, because
they are coming out to set up a guard, and they pulled on out and I remember
watching the car until they got to Harwood and Main, and then I stopped
looking at it and I didn't pay any attention to where it went or anything, and
then I kind of looked back down in there from where I was standing near the
ramp there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when the car came out, what did Vaughn do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Vaughn walked out to the street to hold up traffic, because
they were coming out the wrong way. They don't normally come out that
way and he was going out to hold up traffic and let them get through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he get beyond the sidewalk so that he was actually out
in the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I think he walked out in the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far into the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That would be hard to say but I wasn't paying that much attention,
but he walked out into the street&mdash;he didn't get beyond the center of the
street, but he walked out in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, he left position No. 2 and went to a position
we will call No. 4 by a circle, and I will just write in there "approximate position
of Vaughn when Rio Pierce's car drove out," and when I say "approximate,"
I am understanding you to say that you are not sure how far into the street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
he went, you know he did not go beyond the center stripe, but you think he
<span class="locked">went&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. <span class="locked">Almost&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Out over the sidewalk and into the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes; because there was some cars parked and he had to get
beyond them, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, while you were watching the car and Vaughn, I think you
said you watched the car until it went around the corner. Did you see anybody
go down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No, no; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it have been possible for somebody to have gone to your
left and down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. You mean have gotten between me and there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the building&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Not without me seeing them&mdash;I don't hardly think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, they would have to climb over the little <span class="locked">marble&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Well, I was not exactly against it at that time. When the car
came out, I think I stepped back a little bit, you know, and moved out of the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you said that at one point you were standing on the
Western Union side of that concrete&mdash;what do you call it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I call it a ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Concrete ramp&mdash;sticking out in the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you had your foot on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes; because I was in and out of that position, but when the
car came out, I left that and I stepped back out here a little piece from <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you left the area 3 and went more towards the
street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I went towards the street and kind of back down the sidewalk
a little piece.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went more towards the Main Street curb and back in
the direction of the Western Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, you didn't see anybody go to your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor did you see anybody go down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, after Vaughn had done this and the car had gone around,
what did Vaughn do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. He came back and took his position up again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that it is fair to say then that the position we have marked on
the map as position 2 was also the position of Vaughn after the Rio Pierce
automobile had gone through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what happened after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Let's see, there is something else that I have been thoroughly
confused on&mdash;I have never been able to picture in my mind just how it happened&mdash;the
guy that I saw go into the basement&mdash;I'm not sure it was before
or after the car came out. I'm not sure&mdash;I have run that in my mind a
thousand times, but I just can't place one before the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, in any case, you saw a man go down in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And at the time you saw him go down in the basement, where
was Vaughn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. In position 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In position 2, that is to say, squarely in the middle of the
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Vaughn look at him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I think he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Vaughn try to stop him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He went right on through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how long that was before the shot was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. 3 or 4 minutes, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But what you say is confusing you is as to whether or not that
was after the Rio Pierce car came out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I'm not sure&mdash;I can't place one before the other&mdash;if I had to
guess at it, I would say it was before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you think now that you saw the man go down
past Vaughn before the Rio Pierce car came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That's what I'm thinking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's your best recollection today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when the Rio Pierce car did drive out and Vaughn left
his position at No. 2, didn't you as a matter of fact undertake to watch that
position which was left unguarded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I did notice it to see if anybody went down in it so I could
tell him about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And nobody did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that does not refresh your memory as to whether or not
the man you saw go down, went down before or after the Pierce car came
out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Let me see&mdash;I still think it was before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know that now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No; I can't be positive&mdash;I don't know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn't it a fact that you thought at one time he was the man
you had seen somehow when you were on the police force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Well, yes; and here's what&mdash;when the guy walked down in
there and Vaughn seemed to look at him, the impression I got was that Vaughn
knew him and maybe he had let him out and still, I wondered too why he let
him go down in there, because he wasn't letting anybody else go down in there.
He looked like one of the news reporters or something, at least that's what I took
him to be after Vaughn let him go on down. I had seen him before and I
thought, well, maybe he's one of the news reporters down there at the city
hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me ask you to do this, Mr. Daniels, I have here three documents.
The first one purports to be a copy of an interview with the State
police, I think, or the city police, in the course of which you executed an affidavit
on November 29, 1963.</p>

<p>I'm going to mark that for purpose of identification as follows:</p>

<p>"Dallas, Tex., April 16, 1964, Exhibit No. 5325, deposition of N.&nbsp;J. Daniels,"
and I am signing my name below it. There are two pages. I am marking
the second page with my initials in the lower right-hand corner. Then there's
another document which purports to be a report of an interview with the
FBI Agents Neil Quigley and John Dallman, which interview occurred on December
4, 1964. That document has four pages. I am marking in the right
hand margin on the first page, the following:</p>

<p>"Dallas, Tex., April 16, 1964, Exhibit No. 5326, Deposition of N.&nbsp;J. Daniels."
I am writing my name below that and marking the second and third and fourth
pages of that with my initials in the lower right-hand corner, and finally, there
is another document which is an FBI report of an interview with Bramblett
[spelling] B-r-a-m-b-l-e-t-t and Dallman, taken of you on December 18, 1963,
and I am marking that:</p>

<p>"Dallas, Tex., April 16, 1964, this is Exhibit 5327, Deposition of N.&nbsp;J. Daniels."</p>

<p>I am marking my name on it and since the document consists of three pages,
I am placing my initials in the lower right-hand corner of the second and third
pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Now, Mr. Daniels, I would like you to read these three documents with this
in mind, that after you have had a chance to read them calmly and quietly,
take all the time you want, I would like you to look at them and be able to comment
upon them.</p>

<p>For instance, I am going to ask you if they are correct, or what is wrong
about them, and I want to try to reconcile them, and see if we can get at what
are really the facts as you recollect the facts today. We are not interested in
any positions of mind or concepts that you don't really have, but that other
people might have driven you to, with good motive or not, what we want now
is forgetting about whatever anybody else told you, what your recollection is
right now&mdash;today, without reference to anything else, if you can possibly do it.</p>

<p>Keep that in mind&mdash;forget about suggestions made to you in all good faith
by other people, and just cut that out of your mind and let's just do that&mdash;that
scene as you saw it, and these words today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am going to give you some time to look at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. [Examining instruments referred to.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Daniels, you have had an opportunity to read the
exhibits that I have marked Exhibits Nos. 5325, 5326, and 5327. Now, have
you any comment to make with respect to the three exhibits and the statements
made by you in them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. They said three people was in the car&mdash;it seems like I saw
four&mdash;all of them had on these white supervisor caps, leather top hats that
the supervisors wear down there and it just seemed like I saw four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, what you are saying in effect now is that the people
who reported in these exhibits that you said you saw three were wrong, or
that you were wrong in telling them three, because your present recollection is
that there were four?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I think it was four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are there any other corrections that you wish to make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Let's see. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I don't remember&mdash;corrections.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, it is my duty to call your attention to Exhibit 5325, which
is the affidavit that you made on November 29.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. November 29? What I said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And in Exhibit 5327, which is the report of an interview by
the agents of the FBI on December 18, you seem to quite clearly state that the
man you saw walk down the ramp past Vaughn, did so after the car had
passed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Well, I said I think I have changed my mind now&mdash;I believe
it was after the car had gone out when I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me get it straight&mdash;what is your present impression now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That's it&mdash;the way I fix it in my mind&mdash;the way I arrive at that
conclusion is that when the shot rang out, my first thought was the guy
that just walked down in there did that, so timing that way it would have to
be after that car came out, because that car had time to go quite a ways, I
think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you are saying then is that, the statements that are contained
in Exhibits 5325 and 5327 you now believe to be correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the statement you made in your deposition earlier today
that you could not be sure whether that man went in before or after was
incorrect? I think you even went further, if my memory serves me right, and
said that your best recollection was that the man had gone down past Vaughn
before the car came out, isn't that what you said earlier in your deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes; until I refreshed myself on it and when I read that I got a
better picture in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that now your testimony is that you think that the man
you saw go by&mdash;past Vaughn, did so after the car had gone out, that is to say,
after Vaughn had left his position at (2), gone out into the street to the approximate
position of (4) and come back again to his position at (2)?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then it was at that time or shortly thereafter that the man
went straight by Vaughn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But that is your present best recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you believe that the thing that has made you change your
mind is that when you read these statements&mdash;it refreshes your memory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you quite sure it refreshes your memory or, are you worried
about contradicting yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No; I'm not worried about contradicting myself, I'm just trying
to be sure and tell the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right&mdash;I want to assure you that it doesn't matter to us whether
you contradict yourself or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is no suggestion made to you here that if you made a
mistake before that any kind of penalty or punishment or prosecution will
follow, because that isn't so, unless you made a wilful misstatement, but I'm not
going into that now. What I want to know now is what really happened. Now,
Mr. Daniels, that's why I asked you before to try to put everything out of
your mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That's the trouble with this&mdash;it has been out of my mind and
I am trying to get it back in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You feel now, considering all the statements you made originally
are the truthful ones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are there any other corrections or additions or deletions that
you would like to make as to the exhibits that have been identified as exhibits
as numbers 5325, 5326, and 5327?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. I can't think of any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think it can be fairly said that anyone who would read
the three exhibits 5325, 5326, and 5327 and who would read the transcript of
your deposition at a later time and who would have the advantage of being
able to follow your deposition on this chart that has been marked as Daniel's
Exhibit 5324, that such a person reading all those documents would have all
of the truth, so far as you know it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And we would have all that you do know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. That's absolutely right&mdash;that's right, I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, is there anything else, have you anything else to
say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. No; I can't think of anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, thank you very much. I am glad you came by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Daniels</span>. All right, thank you.</p>

<h2 id="WJH">TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM J. HARRISON</h2>

<p>The testimony of William J. Harrison was taken at 3:45 p.m., on March 25,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission. Mr. William J. Harrison was accompanied by his
counsel, Ted P. MacMaster.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I was looking through here to see if I could get you a copy
of our rules. Let me state for the record. Correct me if I get the names wrong.
We have here Officer W.&nbsp;J. Harrison of the Dallas Police Department and Mr.
MacMaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Ted P. MacMaster [spelling] M-a-c-M-a-s-t-e-r, assistant
city attorney of the city of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wanted to provide for you, before we even get into the formal
part of it a copy of the rules, and I think this is a complete copy, Mr. MacMaster,
and, if you like, let me hand them to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. That is fine. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And let me state, talk a little bit about this, and then maybe,
if you feel that you would like to stop and take a look at it a little longer,
I would be happy to do that. I will state for the record that my name is Burt
Griffin and I am a member of the advisory staff of the general counsel's office
of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, and
this Commission has been set up pursuant to an Executive Order 11130 by
President Johnson issued November 29, 1963, and also pursuant to a joint
resolution of Congress No. 137. Pursuant to this Executive order and these
resolutions, there have been a set of rules and a procedure prescribed by the
Commission, and I believe, Mr. MacMaster, that what I have just handed you is
a copy, and I believe a complete copy, of the rules, but if you would like for me to
check and make sure that is everything, I will check with one of my colleagues.
<span class="locked">Would&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Yes; I would appreciate that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you like me to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will have to take it.</p>

<p>(Recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. For the record, I have checked with my colleague, Mr. Leon
Hubert, and he confirms my statement to you that that is a complete copy of
the rules of the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. I would like to state for the record, Officer William J. Harrison,
a member of the police department of the city of Dallas, Tex., is making a
voluntary appearance here today and is here for the purpose of voluntarily assisting,
in every way possible, in this investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I certainly appreciate that, and let me take some time here to
explain to you what is involved here. This Commission was set up under this
resolution and this Executive order, which I have given you a copy of, for the
purpose of investigating, evaluating, reporting back to President Johnson upon
the facts surrounding the assassination of the President and the killing of Lee
Harvey Oswald. Now, we have asked Mr. Harrison to come here today to talk
with him in particular about the facts that are attendant to the killing of Oswald.
We don't want to preclude any information that you may have that falls anywhere
within the scope of the Commission, so if there is anything, why I would
like you on your own to bring it up and we want very much to hear it.</p>

<p>Let me go back and explain where we are procedurally. Officer Harrison is
appearing here by virtue of a letter, which is sent by the General Counsel of
the Commission to Chief Curry, and the General Counsel, under these resolutions,
has the right to determine who shall be deposed and also has the authority to
authorize individual members of his staff to take individual depositions, and I
have been authorized, pursuant to that letter to Mr. Curry, to take Mr. Harrison's
deposition. Now, the witness is entitled to 3 days' written notice before
he testifies before the Commission, and some of the witnesses have asked for it,
others of them haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. You don't have any reason for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. He wants to waive that 3-day notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Just waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And, also, they have a right to counsel before the Commission.
Many of the witnesses have come before the Commission, and Mr. Harrison is
here with Mr. MacMaster, who is his attorney. Do you have any questions you
want to ask me before I swear the witness in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. No; not that I know of at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Harrison, do you have any questions that you would like to
ask me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I would like to know if I understand. You have the reports
that we made to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. And also the ones that we made to our chief?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, we do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Do we get to read those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you like to see a copy of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes; I haven't seen them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. You want them to refresh your memory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Let me get it out of here. Would you like to take
time and go out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Do you want to take a little time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't you look it over? You can step out of the room.
Maybe I can find another office for you, too.</p>

<p>(Recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I might ask you again if you have any other questions that I can
answer before I swear you in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know of anything. This is off of the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. William J. Harrison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When were you born, Mr. Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. August 28, 1924.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. At 9223 Donnybrook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you employed with the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Past 16 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what particular bureau or subdivision are you attached
to at present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I am a patrolman assigned to the juvenile bureau of the CID.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you working in that capacity or were you a member of the
department in that capacity on November 22, 23, and 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I am going to ask you some questions generally about
events, things have to do with events before the 24th, and I am not going
to go into as much detail as the events of the 24th, but I do want to ask you
where you were at the time that you heard that the President was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Where I was at the time that I heard that the President was
shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I was on duty at the market hall. I was standing at the&mdash;I
guess it would be the west end of the President's table.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the Trade Mart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dallas Trade Mart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir; market.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain there after you heard that the President
was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, it was approximately an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Come back to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The Police Department Building or the city hall portion of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, to the juvenile bureau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you go up to the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do when you got back to the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I don't recall. Stayed around the office there until time
to go home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time would you estimate that you got back to the police
department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. It was around 1:30 or 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what time did you go off duty that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you have occasion to go out of the building between
the time that you returned and the time that you went off duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall. I don't think I ever went out of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you working on any particular cases that you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, no; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, during the period that you were there prior to 4 o'clock,
did you see anybody on the third floor or elsewhere in the building who you
knew was not a police officer or a member of the press or somebody who was
up on some sort of official business with the police department, did you recognize
anybody that you knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Jack Ruby there at anytime prior to 4 o'clock Friday
afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You do recognize Ruby by sight, do you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know Jack personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I knew him as a businessman as well by sight, and I have
known him for 12 years, I guess, as a businessman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to meet Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I used to go into his place. I was a motorcycle officer,
and we would go into these different places just checking, and he was running
the Silver Spur, I think was the name of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What bureau were you assigned to at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I was in the traffic bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that motorcycle patrol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes; motorcycle patrol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that downtown only?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No. We rode all over the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What particular business did you have in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Oh, we went in, we went into several places, maybe to get a
cold drink, checking maybe to see if there was some drunks in there, just regular,
routine checks more or less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you ever see him on a social basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see him in any capacity other than as a police
officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you in the last 12 years had any part-time jobs while you
were with the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Any part-time jobs while I&mdash;I didn't understand that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; while you were a member of the police department, did
you have any part-time jobs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes; I have had part-time jobs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In connection with any of this part-time work, have you ever
worked with Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of part-time jobs have you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Around parade of homes, working traffic around these parades
of home, and on special occasions, like where they have big traffic problems, and
in, well, you might say, jewelry stores, department stores, working in both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don't have any special trade like carpenter, bricklayer or
anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do when you left the police department at 4
o'clock on Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I drove home, went home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And where were you the remainder of the evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I don't recall at all, but I believe I was at my home. I
don't think I had left the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there something that makes you think you might have been
some place else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No. I just don't remember back that&mdash;if I went anywhere or
not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what shift did you work on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. 8 to 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you report for duty at the <span class="locked">juvenile&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you in the building all day on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. On a Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where you worked out of the building on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I don't recall. It was just a normal, routine day, as far as
our work was concerned, handling the juvenile prisoners and checking those
beeves that we had assigned to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Prior to the time that you went on duty on Saturday, did you
receive any telephone calls or other communications from Jack Ruby or anybody
who was an associate of Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You left the police department about 4 p.m. on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. On Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir. No; I beg your pardon. Yes; it was about 4 o'clock
on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at the time that you left the police department, had you
heard anything about the movement of Lee Oswald, proposed movement of Lee
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, no; I hadn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do Saturday after you left work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I went home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you spend Saturday night at home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Spend Saturday night at home; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time did you report for work on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, anytime on Saturday, did you see Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anywhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see any of his friends or associates anyplace?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know any of his friends or associates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you acquainted with a fellow by the name of George Senator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, during the last year, the year prior to the time that the
President was shot, how often did you have occasion to visit Ruby's place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I believe that I went in his place one time within the last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't&mdash;I don't recall. A group of us. I say a group of us.
Occasionally, we will hear about some juvenile being in a place like that, and
occasionally we will check to see if there are any down there, and, if I recall, I
believe Officer Cutchshaw and myself went down to the Carousel Club one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the course of your duties, did you ever find that Jack Ruby
provided any useful information to the police department?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you or any of the officers that you know in the police department
attempt ever to obtain information out of Jack Ruby with respect to your
duties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I didn't. I don't know if any of the other officers did or
not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There wasn't ever any occasion when you tried to get any assistance
or information from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you arrived for work on Saturday&mdash;Sunday, rather&mdash;you
say you report at 8 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that the normal reporting time in your bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember where you parked your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I parked it over by the garage on Young Street, and actually,
well, it was on a parking lot there next to the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Young <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what intersection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Young and Pearl Expressway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you come into the building with any of your fellow officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what entrance you came into the building
through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I drove into the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am talking about the police department building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I drove into the basement of the city hall there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Oh, I thought you parked your car there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I did. I parked my personal car on the parking lot across from
the police garage on Young and Pearl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I picked up a city car at the garage, drove to the basement of
the city hall, where I parked it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. What car number was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall. Don't have any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there any sort of record that is maintained on what cars you
drive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, we fill out a slip on each car we drive every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you fill out a slip on that car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, where do you get the keys to one of those cars that is over
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. They are left in the car, they are in the cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And are they kept in a locked garage, is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; it is a two-story parking affair, enclosed in a fence up
to, you <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there is a guard on the fence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; there is no guard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was there any particular reason for taking that car that
day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, we always park our personal car and pick up our city car
and drive over close to the city hall there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. And it is part of your responsibility, you ordinarily pick
up a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have a particular car assigned to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, no. We have a pool system.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you drive back with anybody to the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I was alone that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it that you parked the car in the garage of the municipal
building and walked by the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. To the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. When you arrived, were there any newspaper people down
in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. In the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir; not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether there were any TV cameras set up when
you arrived that day in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you came in, I take it that you came in down the Main
Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there a guard on the Main Street ramp at the time that
you came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do when you got up to the third floor? Is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I went to the juvenile bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go to the locker room first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You went right up to the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who was there in the juvenile bureau when you
got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No. Goolsby was working the desk and Mrs. McLine was
there and Miller and Lowery. I believe Cutchshaw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anybody else that you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Captain Martin there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall seeing him when I first come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you arrived, what did you do as soon as you arrived up
there in the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. We checked to see what we had assigned to us. They assign
the beeves of a morning when we first come in and put a copy of it in our
drawer, and we always check the first thing to see if we have any messages or
if there has been anything assigned to us to work on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you have anything assigned to you at that time to
work on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what you did after you checked your assignments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, Miller and I went to eat breakfast. I don't know the
exact time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long would you estimate that was after you arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't have any idea. Approximately 20 or 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you talk with anybody concerning what was going on
in the homicide office or what was going on in connection with Lee Oswald when
you came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I beg your pardon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you come into the juvenile bureau, did you talk to any of
the people in connection with what was happening with Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Not that I recall. I may have asked if he was still up there.
I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time that&mdash;excuse me.</p>

<p>Mr. MacMaster, this is Mr. Hubert of our office. Mr. MacMaster is assistant
city attorney. This is Mr. Harrison, Mr. Hubert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Hello. Glad to see you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time that you arrived in the building, had you heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
anything in connection with the movement of Lee Harvey Oswald to the county
jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I hadn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you heard anything about whether he was going to be
moved at all that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, the&mdash;they were talking, the pressmen were talking about
it out in the hall as we come by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you hear the press people say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. They said he would be moved sometime that morning, and I
couldn't tell you who the pressmen were or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with Officer Miller about this when you got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with any of the officers about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. When Captain Martin came in, I believe we had gone to get
breakfast, and when we got back, they told us to stay around the bureau there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Now, when you went out to get breakfast, where did
you have breakfast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. At the Deluxe Diner there at the 1900 block of Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Whose suggestion was it to go out for breakfast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know. Mine or Miller's one. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ask anybody else to go with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was just you and Miller that went to the Deluxe Diner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see anybody at the Deluxe Diner that you knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know the people who operate the diner or the waitresses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No. I know some of them that work over there, but I don't
recall who was working that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you visit there often enough so that they know you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Some of the employees do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, before you left the juvenile bureau, who did you talk
with before going? You didn't ask anybody to come with you. Did you tell
anybody that you were going out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. We told the deskman, Goolsby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Goolsby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. We were going over to get a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Now, how long did you remain at the Deluxe Diner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I would say around 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anything happen over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk about the movement of Lee Oswald at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No. We didn't know anything about it then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what you talked about over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Speculation about whether they were going to get a story out of
him, a confession, or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how did you happen to decide to leave the diner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, we were through eating and went back over to the city
hall there to the bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember if you talked with anybody while you were
over at the Deluxe Diner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether you talked with any&mdash;had any telephone
calls when you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I believe I did have a phone call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. What do you remember about the phone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I believe it was Goolsby. He called us and told us not to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
the city hall, that was the captain's order, Captain Martin's order. He told us
to come on back to the bureau when we got through eating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, when you got back to the bureau, did you report
back in to Goolsby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, he saw us come in. We didn't have to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Captain Martin when you got back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I believe he was there when we got back in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to anybody when you got back about the proposed
movement of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No. Of course, it may have been discussed there as to what
time it would be. I don't recall who was talking or what was said, but I know
we were told to stand by the bureau there by Captain Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when did Martin tell you this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, actually, on this phone call Goolsby made over there, he
told us that the captain had told us to stand by there in the bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. When we got back up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did Martin then tell you the same thing when you got up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall whether he did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how long was it between the time that you got this call
from Goolsby and you actually went down to the basement in connection with
the movement of Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I would say about 2 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you came back from the diner, how did you come back
into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Came across to Harwood Street and down to the Harwood
Street entrance to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And when you went out, did you go out that way or did you
go out by the Commerce Street entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Went that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you see anybody around the police building at that time
whom you recognized that wasn't either a police officer or a newspaperman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir; when we came back, there was a man by the name
of Johnny Miller, who owns a trailer house sales on West Davis. It is right
across from Sivils parking lot there. It is a trailer sales company. He was
standing in the door of this television company truck talking, and he turned
around and shook hands with me and spoke to me, and I went on in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what he said to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. He just spoke to me and shook hands with me said he was
glad to see me, and that is the extent of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does Miller know Ruby, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know. I don't know that, whether he knows him
or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anything that would lead you to think that he might?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I have known Miller just about the same length of time
that I have known Ruby, but I don't know whether he even knew Ruby or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is Miller a close, personal friend of yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, no; just an acquaintance. Oh, I have stopped out there
at his place and sat there and talked to him and have gone and had coffee with
him, but just an acquaintance, not a personal friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this a TV sales and repair shop that he runs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; a house trailer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am sorry. House trailer. House trailer. Okay. Now, do
you remember what you did in those roughly 2 hours between the time you
got back up to the juvenile bureau and the time that you went down to the
basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir; I don't recall, except sitting up there answering the
phone and just checking on beeves that I had had assigned to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you all keeping your eye out for when Oswald would be
moved?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, we knew that we would be told, that someone would
come and get us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any idea of what would be the occasion for moving
Oswald, what would be done before Oswald would be moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you aware that the homicide people were questioning
Oswald at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. We didn't know they were. We assumed that they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there reporters running in and out of the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were they talking about the events that were going on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. They were mostly using the phone. They weren't talking to
us. They were mostly calling their home office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. They were using the phone in your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were able to hear what they were saying over the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I didn't pay any attention to what they were saying. There
were three of us in there that morning. All we told them was to leave us three
lines open because we were pretty busy ourselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the next thing you recall in connection with the movement
of Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. About, I would say, 3 or 4 or 5 minutes to 11. I went down
to the subbasement to get me some cigars, and as I come back up out of the
subbasement, well, then the officers out of our bureau were going across from
the elevator to the&mdash;to there in front of the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there are two basements, as I understand it, in the Police
and Courts Building. One is the basement level that the garage is on and the
jail office and the records room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then there is a subbasement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Locker room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Locker room down below that. Now, how did you get down
from the third floor into the subbasement? Does the elevator go all of the
way down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, no; it stops at the floor where the jail office is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. When you get out of the jail office, where do you
have to go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, actually to the south end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You walk down to the hallway and then you open a door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; you go down a stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Go down a stairway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Into the subbasement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there is, is there not, a doorway, as you walk from Commerce
Street down the steps to go to the door that entered into the building
and through the hallway that you had walked down? Do you follow me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, no; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let's suppose that you walked from the record room to the subbasement
by way of the hallway that leads out towards Commerce Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, that hallway has a door that goes out of the building,
does it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And when you open that door and go out of the building, there
are two other doors, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, isn't there a door on your&mdash;on your left as you face Commerce
Street, isn't there a door on your left that goes into the engine room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Actually, I have never&mdash;I believe there is a door there. It is
underneath where the stairway goes up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there is a door straight ahead where the stairway goes up?
In other words, as you walk out of the door from the building to leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
building and you step out of there, there is another door right in front of you
right under this <span class="locked">stairs&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Isn't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, that door leads down to the subbasement, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I have never been down that way. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. From the assembly room, in the assembly room,
where is this cigar dispensing machine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. They are not in the assembly room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Not in the assembly room, in the locker room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. In the locker room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where is it located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know how to describe it to you. The machine is about,
I guess, 18 foot from the door&mdash;from the stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the far south end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; it is kind of west of the stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. West of the stairway, but it is on the south side of the room, it
is on the side closest to Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; that is where all of the locker rooms are, lockers are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Now, there is a door that separates the locker room from the
area where the cold drinks and where <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Where the cold drinks and the cigar machine and the cigarette
machines are, there is a door that separates that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We are all talking about the same thing here. I am not sure
that Mr. MacMaster knows what we are talking about here. Would you draw
Main Street or draw Commerce Street up on one end, which is convenient to
you, and draw Harwood, and why don't you label them, write "Main," "Commerce,"
and "Harwood" in the appropriate spots? All right. Where is the
doorway that you entered the locker room by, where would that be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, now, this being the stair down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There is no door here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There is a wall approximately in this position and there is a
double door here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. All right. There is a big post here. It has a telephone on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Cigar machine sits right here beside of this post.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. And the Dr. Pepper and coke machines are all up and down
this right side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. What is in this area to the south of the doorway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. This?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Lockers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you draw that in there, write that in there? Write
"Locker Room" or something. Did you have a locker in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was your locker located, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Down here, however it hadn't been used in over 2½ or 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see anybody down here when you went down there to get
the cigars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There was no one down there when I went down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any occasion to go into the locker room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do after you got the cigars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Went back upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you see anybody on the way up or down whom you
recognized as not being a newspaperman or a police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, at that time, there was no one in that immediate area.
The officers were going across from the elevator to the jail office, the officers
out of the juvenile bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So when you came up, you found the officers had left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I mean had left the juvenile bureau, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, they were leaving the elevator coming across.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you met them in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Met them in the basement, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And who did you see there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, there was Miller, Lowery and Cutchshaw, Goolsby, and I
believe that was all out of our bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what did you do when you saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. One of them told me to come on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember which one that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And where did you go with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. We stood in front of the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what happened as you waited around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, we were waiting around to get&mdash;find out where they were
going to put us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you finally get some instructions from somebody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I believe it was Captain Jones that come in and told us that&mdash;to
come on out into the area there in the driveway, and he told us that he
wanted all of the newsmen on the east side of the drive and that he wanted
nothing but officers over in this corridor here and where the&mdash;well, on the west
wall, in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, let's go off of the record here. I want to find out.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark this diagram that you have drawn here
Harrison Exhibit 5027, and I am going to ask you, Officer Harrison, if you will
just put in here "coke machine" or whatever these things are, "cigar machine."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. This is a post here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A post. A support post. All right. Why don't you mark that
post, then? And then mark the area where the&mdash;okay. Now, and that is
"door." Okay. Now, would you sign that any place where you can get your
signature and then date it?</p>

<p>(Recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We were at the point where you had come into the basement area
and seen the people coming down from the juvenile bureau. Before you went
down there, had you left word that you would be down in the locker room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes; I told Goolsby that I was going down and get me some
cigars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did there come a time when you were down in the basement
that somebody gave you some instructions as to what was to be done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Captain Jones, I believe it was, had come out and told us to
go out into the ramp area, the garage, and to set&mdash;to put these photographers and
newspeople on the east side of the driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you take this map, diagram or chart (Harrison Exhibit
5028) which is&mdash;actually is a reduction of a chart that the Dallas Police Department
made for us some time ago and purports to represent the basement area?
You can see the jail office here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you can see Commerce Street over here and Main Street
here and the garage area here and the Main Street ramp going down and the
Commerce Street ramp going up, and this shows a solid wall along Commerce
Street here. Actually, this is the basement wall. The basement extends out
under the sidewalk, but if you were looking at this at ground level, you would
see this broken line is the wall of the building. Now, directing your attention to
the part that shows the exit from the jail office and the ramps and the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
into the garage, can you mark on there what Captain Jones&mdash;how Captain
Jones indicated that the newspeople were to be displaced by the officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. He wanted them across along here on this side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you want to put a series of "X's" or something along there
to show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. You want to put "news"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; you might put some mark on there. This would be news
media, newspeople, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't you mark that "news," also? Now, were there to be
any newspaper people from the northern side of the entrance to the garage on
up toward the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There were some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But what instructions did he give in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. He didn't. He just stated that he wanted them on the east
side of the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did he say anything with respect to whether he wanted
them on the east side or the west side of the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; he didn't specify that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it your understanding that there were to be no news media
in this area other than the TV people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. In this area right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What about in the area to the north of where you have placed
the "X's"? Was it your understanding <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There were floodlights standing here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where you are placing circles on the map. Now, did he give&mdash;go
ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There were cameras here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did he give instructions as to where the police officers were
to stand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he give any instructions with respect to forming any lines
of police officers or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I didn't hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how long was this before Lee Oswald was brought down
that these instructions were given?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. This was approximately, oh, maybe 10 or 11 minutes before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do in that 10 or 11 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I took up a position in the ramp area here and assisted with
getting the newsmen on the east side of the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you stay in the same general area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I did; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you indicate on the map by a circle and an "X" where was
it you were, generally?</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Actually, Mr. MacMaster, if you feel like you would like to
recess this at some particular hour, let me know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Let me suggest this. Do you have any idea how long this
interrogation will last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wouldn't expect it to go more than 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. More?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; I don't think it will go any longer than that, <span class="locked">however&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. What is your&mdash;would you just rather stay and finish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I would rather stay and finish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. All right. I wonder if I may make my one phone call here on
the phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. May I ask you something here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Let's wait until he finishes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Well, let's go ahead. My 13-year-old daughter is on the
phone, so that is a career itself trying to get home. I am not going to worry
about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Feel free at any time to interrupt me. Go ahead. You wanted
to ask me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I made these two things setting too far away. Actually, this
camera was setting in this first aisle, one of them was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. The cameras were right in line here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you were making an effort to steer these news people over
into this area and away from the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall when Sam Pierce's car drove out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir; I do. I let the&mdash;I had to move the people back out
of the way. There was actually two cars went out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There were two cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, tell me about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, there was a patrolman went out that direction in a
squad car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I believe it was Mr. O'Dell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how long before or after Pierce's car did he go out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, now, it was some 3 or 4 or 5 minutes, something like
that, I am sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, let's focus on Mr. O'Dell's car, then. Was
anybody in the car with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what&mdash;for what purpose he went out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What division is he assigned to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Radio patrol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were you aware, while you were down in the basement,
of anybody being dispatched to change the positioning of the people along the
street who were supposed to block off Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any knowledge at all of how the route was to go,
how Oswald was to be conveyed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever have any knowledge as to what was to be used
to convey him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, when we got down there, they were bringing this
armored car, backing the armored car, into the south end or Commerce Street
side of the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall or would you have been in a position to see
whether the armored car was actually in the ramp when you arrived on the
scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. They were backing it in at the time that we came out into
the driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Were you able to tell whether it would appear that it
had just got to the ramp or how long it had been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did O'Dell get his car from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know that. The first time I noticed it was when
he came up here through the newsmen. I got them to move back where he
could get by, and then there was a couple of men standing up here talking. I
believe it was one of the&mdash;one of the supervisors talking to a reserve captain,
who was standing there. I believe it was Arnett. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there were&mdash;at the time that O'Dell's car went out, there
were police officers in the direction of the Main Street ramp, closer to Main
Street than you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you place on there all of the&mdash;all right. Let me strike
that. Go ahead. Tell me what you want to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. At the time that O'Dell's car came out, I was back here, in this
position here, to help get these men out of the way of the car, and then
it was shortly after that that I took up this position here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. All right. Now, at the time that O'Dell's car came out&mdash;well,
let's strike this. Prior to the time that O'Dell's car came out, were you
ever in this area here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes; I was moving from this area around to here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. In other words, <span class="locked">keeping&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Maybe we can do this sort of like a football diagram.
Why don't you put your initials right there? And down here why
don't you draw a circle and an "X" and just say, "Initial placement of Harrison"?
Now, why don't you draw an arrow to the general direction of where
you were and put a "1" and draw a circle around that, and then down in the
corner, put a "1" and a circle and put, "Position when O'Dell's car started to
move," if that is correct? Now, when O'Dell's car moved, were there police officers
between you and Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There was&mdash;I believe there was a captain&mdash;I don't recall who
it was&mdash;I believe it was Captain Jones, though&mdash;talking to this uniformed
reserve captain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Solomon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; Arnett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Arnett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. In the Dallas reserves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any other police officers up in that general direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There were officers out in this area right in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are pointing to the area north of the entrance to the jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, no; right along the side here. See, this was lined with
officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The first place that you indicate to is the south wall of the
entranceway toward the jail office and up to the corner of the ramp and then
along the ramp, the east wall of the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. West wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. West wall of the ramp toward Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is where there were police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. And also that there were police officers along the north
wall of the entranceway leading toward the door of the jail office, officers
right in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, as O'Dell's car moved up the ramp, what did
you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I just moved these men back and&mdash;or asked them to move
back&mdash;and let him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh. Now, did you watch his car go up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see what Jones and Arnett did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I didn't. Well, I know they moved back out of the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there news people strung across the Main Street ramp
who had to be moved out of the way in order to let O'Dell's car move through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Not at that time, not on O'Dell's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what then happened? Where did you then go after
O'Dell's car went up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Back into my original area. It was about halfway between
the ramp and&mdash;the rail and the west wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you looking around the area generally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, if anybody had come down the Main Street ramp while
you were standing there up until the time that Pierce's car went out, would
you have seen him come down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Would you repeat that, now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If anybody had come down the Main Street ramp up to the
time, between the time that O'Dell's car left and the time that Pierce's car went
up, would you have seen the person who was coming down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't think I would have. I was facing more or less back
in this <span class="locked">particular&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. At any time during those few minutes between
O'Dell's car leaving and Pierce's car leaving, did you look in the direction of
the Main Street ramp or over in the direction of the garage area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Now, if Jack Ruby had been in that area during that
period, would you have seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, why do you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know whether I would have seen him or not. It was
mass confusion, as far as people moving around in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But the confusion was over in the area at the entrance of the
garage, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And this area up the Main Street ramp was relatively clear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you knew Jack Ruby well enough, certainly as well as
you know Mr. MacMaster, if you saw him just even briefly, you would recognize
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So if at any time you had looked over in that area and Jack
Ruby were there, you would have seen him, wouldn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, it was very hard to see in this direction at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the direction of the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. In this position. These floodlights were very bright.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. They had&mdash;I don't know how many they had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long were the floodlights on prior to the time that Oswald
came out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were they&mdash;try to think about this, now&mdash;were they on when
you first came into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I don't believe they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, they were taken&mdash;did you know whether or not, when the
armored car came down the Commerce Street ramp, the, TV cameras, any of the
TV cameras, were focused on that armored car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I didn't notice that. He didn't get all of the way down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time that Rio Pierce's car moved out, were the floodlights
on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time that O'Dell's car moved out, were the TV cameras&mdash;were
the floodlights on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall whether they were on or off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you have any trouble seeing up in the direction of the
armored car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And standing, from where you were, even in the center of the
entranceway toward the jail office, you could see up the ramp toward the
armored car and you could recognize the faces of people up there, couldn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Possibly, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there&mdash;other than the little difficulty we all experience
with vision, either through age or what-not, was there anything unusually difficult
about looking up in the direction and seeing in the direction of the Commerce
Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how far up the ramp was the armored car or how far down
the ramp, I should say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I didn't go up there, but it appeared to be setting just
backed into the doorway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you say it was halfway down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; it wasn't halfway down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were there officers, police officers, standing up there around
the back of the armored car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I remember seeing Lieutenant Butler up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And could you distinguish these police officers from the position
in the middle of the entranceway to the jail office where you have marked your
initial, where you have marked your initial position on the ramp here, could
you, looking up towards Commerce Street, could you distinguish the faces of the
police officers up there, could you recognize who they were, toward the armored
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I recognized Lieutenant Butler, but I don't recall seeing&mdash;now,
Chief Batchelor was around the truck. They went in and out of the
truck there inspecting it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you recall seeing him up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh. And you didn't have any difficulty seeing Batchelor
from your position on the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And presumably the same situation would prevail if you looked
up toward the Main Street ramp, isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you ever have occasion to look up toward the Main
Street ramp and see the police officer who was guarding the exit to the ramp
up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There was a uniformed officer up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, from where you were down here at what we have called
your initial position, on the time or times that you looked up toward that uniformed
officer up there, could you make out his face and what-not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I never did see his face. All I could see was a man in uniform
up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, we have learned subsequently, and you have, too, I am
sure, that that was Officer Vaughn that was up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Vaughn before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you able to tell from where you were that it was Vaughn
up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I didn't know who it was up there. I could just see his
uniform and back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it because he didn't turn his face to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. He was facing out when I looked up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You feel that, if he turned his face toward you, you would
have recognized who it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I would probably have recognized him; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you if the same thing is true, when you looked up
toward the Commerce Street entrance and the sidewalk, there were&mdash;do you
remember that there were officers guarding up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I couldn't see any officers out there. It was considerably
darker up on this end of the ramp due to the fact that the armored truck had
the light blocked off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I mean the vision, it was pretty well&mdash;the whole ramp area
was pretty well taken up by that truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Let me make sure that I am clear on that. I don't want
to put words in your mouth. Is it fair to say that, if on any occasion that you
had to look up toward the Main Street ramp, if there had been a man walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
down that ramp, you or any other officer with vision like yourself would have
been able to recognize that person coming down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know whether you could have recognized him or
not due to the fact that you were looking into sunlight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, that is the north side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. That is on the north side of the building, but it was very bright
that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you also had floodlights down in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was bright in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Your eyes would be accustomed to those bright lights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. A man coming down, if he got close to you, you could recognize
him, but just a man in a suit walking down that ramp, it would have been hard
to recognize. I will put it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, would a man walking down from the Main Street side have
been any more difficult to recognize than a man that was standing up in the
position that Captain Butler was or Assistant Chief Batchelor was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Batchelor and Butler, Lieutenant Butler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would it have been any more difficult to recognize a man coming
down the Main Street ramp than it would those two men coming up the Commerce
Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes; I believe it would have been, due to the glare in your face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were you keeping an eye out generally for people, news
people, who might try to drift over into that area, and by "that area," I am
referring to the area along the Main Street ramp, across the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Would you ask that question again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. And point out there, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. I am referring to the area that goes directly across the
Main Street ramp down to the base of the ramp. That area, as I understand it,
was supposed to be kept clear. Were you keeping an eye out to make sure
that people didn't congregate in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There was several officers in this area right in here. I don't
know the names of them. I couldn't spot any of them for you. There was one
newsman, who had a microphone, immediately to my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, your right as you faced in what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. As I was facing south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That would be toward Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At what point was there a man there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. He was even with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I mean at what <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Oh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In this series of events.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. He was in that general area all of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you keep an eye on him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No. I wasn't particularly watching him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any other news people who were there in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There was a Japanese photographer on my left, immediately
to my left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, this Officer Harrison, this position that you have marked
here as the initial position, is that also approximately the position you were
standing at the time that Oswald walked out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. So that, when you say on your left there, are you
talking about at the time that Oswald actually walked out, that is where that
Japanese photographer, newsman, was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Put an "X," if you would, put a small "J" on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
map where that man was and put a circle around it. Now, that is where the
Japanese photographer was standing at the time that Oswald walked <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that right? Now, where was this man with the microphone
standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. He was immediately to my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't you put an "M" and a circle around him? Now,
were there any other police officers over in this general area where you 3 people
were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who were the other police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, when Rio Pierce's car came out, what did you
do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I got these people to move back out of the way and let him
through, and I stepped back to the rail, toward the lights there and let him
through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, did you have your back to the railing or were
you facing the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I had my back to the railing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you watch Pierce's car go up the ramp at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I watched it until it cleared the people in that immediate area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many people were there to clear out in that immediate
area, would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, there was seven or eight, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You wouldn't say there were as many as 20 or 25, would you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were those people all newspaper people, members of the
press, or were there some police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There were some police officers in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh. Now, at the time that Oswald actually came out of
the jail office, how many lines of people, would you say, were strung along in
that area that you were? Was there more than one line of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Now, where are you referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As I understand it, as Oswald walked out, there was a line of
people that came from the <span class="locked">north&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Northwest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What corner are we going to call that, northwest or northeast?
I think this would be the west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Northwest, that is right, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to put "Northwest corner" here so we will know
what we are talking about. There was a line of people, was there not, from
what I have marked the northwest corner of the Main Street wall all of the way
over to you and then around here? No?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. I am honestly trying to find out here how these people
were lined up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, due to these lights and the cameras being here, this area
was open. There was, like I say, this Japanese, and there was another man
or two in that area here, whom I don't&mdash;I don't have any idea who he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Just put a couple of question marks there. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. And behind me, there were&mdash;not immediately behind me, but
back in this <span class="locked">area&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Toward the west wall, there was police and also Captain Arnett
of the reserves standing&mdash;he was standing fairly close to me behind me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was Captain Arnett? Put an "A" where you think he
was and then put a circle around that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. He was in that general area somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time that Oswald walked out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes; I believe he was. I am <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember seeing him there about that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I remember seeing the uniform there, and he was the captain
who was in the uniform down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you remember seeing these people over here at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. They were&mdash;yes; they were there. There were, I believe, two
people right in here and there were the cameramen behind the rail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Blackie, do you remember this from actual memory of what
happened or do you remember this from having seen the photographs, the films?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I remember these people on my left here and the ones
here on my right. I remember this man with a microphone very distinctly
because, when they brought him out, these fellows back here hollered for me
to move the line back, which I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you remember if there were any people directly behind
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; not that I recall. I remember I spread my arms out and
backed the group up where these cameras could get a clear shot of him coming
out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is it fair to say that, if there had been people in back
of you, you would have either known it because you were looking around there
or because you would have wanted to have cleared them out or would have
been worried about it or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I wouldn't necessarily have seen them, because I was
watching this line across here to keep them from going forward into the path
of this&mdash;of where Oswald was coming out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at any time after Rio Pierce's car went up that ramp, did
you look in the direction of the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Not that I recall; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see any other officers look in the direction of the ramp
during that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, while you were over here, as Rio Pierce's car drove out,
were other officers lined up <span class="locked">along&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The other wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And, to your knowledge, were any of them looking out in this
direction toward the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I didn't notice any of them looking out that way. They could
have been. There was&mdash;I know, when they brought Oswald out, Lowery was
standing right here on the&mdash;on this corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you put a mark, put an "L" there where Lowery was? Did
you at any time, now, did you see Jack Ruby in this basement at any time before
he shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Not before he shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you were standing here, did you feel a man pressing up
against your back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of course, you have seen the photographs, haven't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you saw where Jack came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anybody that you know of that saw Ruby there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you talked to anybody that indicated to you that he saw
Ruby there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I sure haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do after Ruby shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I grabbed him and more or less went to the floor with
him and then we took him on into the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how long did you remain with him in the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Until he was handcuffed, and I went upstairs on the elevator
with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how long did you remain with him upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I didn't. I left him at the elevator. McMillon and Archer
went back, took him on back to the cell, and I went back down on the elevator
to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do&mdash;you weren't present, were you, when Jack
was stripped and searched?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got back down to the basement, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I went back out into the ramp area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you&mdash;how long did you remain in the ramp area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, it was about&mdash;until after the ambulance left with Oswald,
and then the captain&mdash;I believe it was Captain Jones&mdash;sent me up to the first
floor to see that no one come in there in that&mdash;on the first floor that wasn't authorized.
We were given orders to stop everyone and see if they were going
out of the building to find out who they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Whereabouts did you station yourself on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I was right there in front of the elevators, at the elevator door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you there alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There was&mdash;well, there was three or four more officers on that
floor. There was one at every door and exit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Officer Miller up there with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall where Miller was at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Officer Lowery up there with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Officer Cutchshaw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know whether they were or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to anybody while you were up there or before you
got up there concerning how Ruby got into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I told Chief Batchelor, just after I come back downstairs
from taking him up&mdash;I told Chief Batchelor that I thought he come from behind
those cameras over there, but&mdash;and that is where I thought he come from
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, why did you think he came from behind the cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, there was&mdash;he came from my left, and I don't see how
he could get down the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did you feel that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I knew there was an officer on the ramp and I just didn't
feel like he could have gotten down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you also feel that you would have seen him if he had come
down that ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, not necessarily; because I wasn't looking toward the ramp
all of the time. I never&mdash;had I been turned where I could have seen the ramp
all of the time, I may have seen him coming down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If Jack had been in that&mdash;were you moving around such after
Rio Pierce's car moved that, if Jack had been down there in the basement area,
you would have seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Not necessarily; it is possible that he could have been down
there and I wouldn't have seen him because he had been back over in this group
of newsmen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right; but if he had been in the area of the ramp, if he had
been up in this area where you were and around up toward the Main Street ramp,
would you have seen him if he had been in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I might have. I don't&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There weren't enough news people milling around up in that
area to have obscured him, were there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Not in that immediate area; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, if anybody had been turning and looking up
toward the Main Street ramp, there wouldn't have been enough newspaper people
in there to have obscured the sight of Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't suppose there would have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I am not trying to put words in your mouth. I want to
make this very clear. I am giving you a direct question like this, but if you
feel differently, I want to know if you disagree with me. I am asking a leading
question here, but I want to make sure that I am not <span class="locked">leading&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. What was the question again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If Jack Ruby had been in this area at the base of the Main
Street ramp, there wouldn't have been enough newspaper people there? The
fact that there were newspaper people around wouldn't have obscured the
sight of him from anybody that was looking up in that direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't think it would have obscured him, had they been
looking in that direction. Now, I did, as I said a while ago, I have looked at
some films, and I did look to my left, <span class="locked">oh&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. By "left," you mean up in the direction of the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. When this guy hollered to me to move the crowd back, I looked
to my left and backed the people up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Your left would be up in the direction of the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; it would be toward the cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Toward the cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Television cameras, yes; over in this direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And, as you looked over there, you didn't see Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember looking over there like that or do you only
remember it from having seen the photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; when they hollered, I glanced over there to see where we
were in trying <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. In trying to get out of line of those cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you remember, as you looked over there, whether you
had any difficulty in seeing people over in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There wasn't anyone in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In front of the cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; there was no one in front of the cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What would you say would be the total number of people,
including newspaper people and police officers, who were strung from the northwest
corner over toward the cameras at the time Oswald came out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I would say maybe eight or nine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, now. How long did you remain up there by those
elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, it was, I imagine, 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what did you do when you left the elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Went back upstairs to the bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which bureau, now, juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Juvenile bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do in the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. We stayed there until they told us to&mdash;Captain Jones told
us to go up to homicide bureau and write a report as to what we saw and what
we did on this thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, did Captain Jones give the instructions to write
a report to everybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, he told&mdash;I didn't hear him give it to everybody. He told
me and Cutchshaw and Lowery to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Miller up there at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall whether Miller was there or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it your understanding that Jones was trying to contact
everybody to get them to write a report as quickly as possible?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, now, I don't know about that. He came up there and
told me to report back to the bureau, and when we got to the bureau, well, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
told&mdash;came in and told Lowery, myself, and Cutchshaw&mdash;I remember that very
distinctly&mdash;to go into Captain Fritz' office and write a report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, about what time would you say you wrote that report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't have any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, let me ask you this, then. Maybe this will place it.
After you wrote that report, you went out to Love Field, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what time would you estimate that you went to Love
Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, we were supposed to be out there when Mayor Cabell's
plane left. I believe it was at 5:20, and we left the city hall shortly after 4
o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you left the city hall, did you make&mdash;did you report in
with the dispatcher or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; there was no&mdash;we went out in two separate cars and we
went to&mdash;started up Harwood Street, and they gave Lowery a call to return
to the station, and Captain Martin met us there in the basement and briefed us
as to what to do out at Love Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. And then we headed on out to Love Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. But, on this question, I understand you that there
would not be any record in the office, such as a dispatcher's record or something
like that, that would show when you left for Love Field, or would there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. There would be a record of what time he gave Lowery that
call to return to the station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. And that was a call from captain who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you had already started <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And turned around and came back? Okay; now, how much
time elapsed between the time that you finished&mdash;well, strike that. Did you
finish writing the report in the homicide office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much time elapsed between when you finished that report
in the homicide office and you got in your car to go out to Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't have any idea, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it right away or did you go back to the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, we went back to the juvenile bureau; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is there an original copy&mdash;you wrote that report by hand,
didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, and is that&mdash;I am going to call a halt here and I am
going to mark a couple of exhibits. All right. I am going to hand you, Mr.
Harrison, what I have marked as Exhibit No. 5030. Now, this is a copy of a
letter, which you apparently signed and was addressed to Chief Curry dated
November 24. Now, let me ask you, did you write that out in hand first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you know whether your office has retained handwritten
copies of those reports?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No. It was&mdash;I am sure it was thrown away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, who did you turn your handwritten copy over to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know who typed it up. I know this was signed and
sent in by, I think, Lieutenant Wallace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Would you do this for me? After we finish here,
would you check with Captain Martin and Lieutenant Wallace and find out
from them if the handwritten copies of the things&mdash;of your report, handwritten
copy of your report, is <span class="locked">available&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If it has been retained? I believe that you will find that
many of these were retained. There are other officers who have been able
to get these for us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And so I am inclined to believe that it is probably available
someplace, and if you will get that and turn it over to us, I would appreciate
that very much. We will make a copy of it and return the original to
the department, but I would like a copy of that. Now, do you remember
whether or not&mdash;do you remember any of the people who were in the homicide
office when you filled out that report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Cutchshaw, myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any of the homicide people who were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember if Fritz was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. He was in and out of there during the time that we were in
there, but I don't recall how long he stayed or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember if Montgomery was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, Montgomery was in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you happen to know about Montgomery being there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I know Montgomery very well. In fact, I used to be
close neighbors to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. And I do remember him being in there. I remember that
very clearly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you talk with Montgomery at all about what had happened
down in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were in the juvenile bureau, before you left to go
to Love Field, did you hear any rumors as to how Ruby got in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No. They were talking about&mdash;Lowery said that he thought
that he may have come by with a camera that was moved across just prior to the
time that Pierce's car went out, and they were talking about the number of
men who were on that camera, the particular camera. And&mdash;but that is the
only discussion I heard as to how he may have got in there. For some time
there, we thought that may have been the way he got in, I mean the men in my
particular bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did Lowery first tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, he had started talking about this when we were in
the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And while you were in the basement, did you hear any other
rumors as to how he got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir; sure didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as long as you were at the juvenile bureau, did you hear
any rumor about his coming down the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, no; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with Officer McMillon on the day before you
went to the juvenile bureau and after Ruby was shot&mdash;I mean Oswald was
shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Officer Archer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, now, they went up on the elevator with me, I found
out later, but I didn't see them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or Clardy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't remember whether Clardy was on there or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall if Dean was on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you talk with Dean at any time on the 24th after
Ruby was shot&mdash;Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, I didn't talk with Dean at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to any people in the patrol <span class="locked">division&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Afterward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At any time on Sunday, that is, the day that Oswald was shot,
did you hear the rumor that Ruby came down the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got back&mdash;what time did you get back to the
juvenile bureau on Friday&mdash;I mean on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. It was well after 6 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you&mdash;when you got back there, did you talk with anybody
about how Ruby might have got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I went on home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear any discussion from <span class="locked">anybody&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From anybody about how&mdash;well, weren't people generally discussing
this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I suppose they were, but I was tired, and I went home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Wasn't this a big topic of conversation back there at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. When you got back on Monday morning&mdash;did you
come in Monday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you begin to talk with people about how Ruby got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I suppose I did, but I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When is the first time that you recall hearing the rumor that he
came down the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, it would have been possibly Monday. I was off Tuesday
and Wednesday. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did McMillon ever tell you at any time that&mdash;have you
talked with McMillon about this, these events, at any time since Sunday the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. We have had some discussion, but I don't recall what it was.
Of course, we have talked to several.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to Dean at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; I have never talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you friendly to Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; he is in the radio patrol, and I very seldom see the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. How about Archer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Archer, he is in the auto bureau. I see him occasionally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Clardy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Occasionally; I see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, have any of these men told you since the&mdash;since the time
that Oswald was shot by Ruby that Ruby told them that he came in through
the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. They never did tell me that, none of them. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was the first&mdash;go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I heard, after the trial down there&mdash;I heard them discussing,
of course, the evidence that was brought out, and they said that he had made the
statement that he came in that way. And when Lieutenant Wallace and Lieutenant
McCaghren were making their followup investigation, which I don't know
how many days it was after, they had talked that he had, or suggested that he
had, come down the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, they had suggested this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, they had, through their investigation, more or less, they
had kind of&mdash;I guess you would make a theory out of it that he had come down
the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don't mean that they suggested it, but this is the inference
or the conclusion that they drew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what I would like for you to do is, if you would, sign
Exhibit 5028 and date it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. This is the 25th, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, it is. Isn't it? Yes. I might say for the record, so that
Mr. MacMaster understands, part of the procedures here now permit you to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
any questions that you want of Mr. Harrison, and I am going to just ask him to
identify, sign these documents, identify them, and ask him specifically whether
he has any changes that he would want to make on these, particularly on these
reports and statements, and I am prepared to accommodate myself to your
time on this, if you feel that you want to ask some questions. If you prefer to
adjourn for dinner, or something like that, and come back, I would be happy to
do that, and resume it later on this evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I would rather go ahead with it, if it is agreeable with you all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It doesn't make any difference with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Mr. Harrison, on Exhibit 5026, I believe that was the first
exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Twenty-seven.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Twenty-seven. That is just a reference to the basement area.
Is that the police recreation room or locker room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. That is just a rough hand drawing, you didn't intend that
to be exact to scale in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. That is all. At the time you were down in the basement area
and they brought Oswald down, with the police security measures that were in
effect, you wouldn't have any reason to believe that any unauthorized person
would enter into the area, would <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Because of the police measures in effect at that <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Security measures? In other words, any other unauthorized
persons in the area, in other words, Ruby, would be a big surprise to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. It would; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Was it a surprise to you to see an unauthorized person down
there the first time when he came around you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. It certainly was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Now, on extra duty for police officers, isn't it a standard
departmental policy that you can't work on off-duty work at anyplace serving
alcoholic beverages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Is that the chief's direct order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. That is a direct order. They have special officers for that
type of work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. But it is in the nature of regular police duty, that is, special
officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. But you can't, that is, in civilian clothes, you can't work
anyplace in an off-duty status for extra money in anyplace serving alcoholic
beverages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. That is right; either in uniform or out of uniform.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Harrison, I wonder if you would look at what I have marked
as Exhibits 5029, 5030, and 5031. Five thousand twenty-nine is a report of an
interview of two FBI agents, Wilkinson and Hardin, had with you on December
5, 1963; Exhibit 5030 is a copy of a statement or a letter, which you addressed to
Chief Curry, dated November 24, 1963, entitled, "Subject: Shooting of Lee Harvey
Oswald," and Exhibit 5031 is a copy of&mdash;is a report of an interview that Agent
Bookhout, [spelling] B-o-o-k-h-o-u-t, had with you on November 24, 1963. Have
you looked over these statements today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you want to make any changes or corrections or additions
in there in those statements, keeping in mind the testimony that has already
been given here today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. This on Mr. Bookhout's interview, which was over the telephone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. It was over the telephone. I was at Love Field when <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. To identify that, that is Exhibit 5031 you are referring to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; let me ask you a question there. Do you know how Bookhout
reached you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I had called in to see how long they wanted us to stay out there,
and Lieutenant Coulon identified Mr. Bookhout to me over the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did Bookhout ask you, or did anybody ask you, if any other
officers were out there with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did Bookhout talk to those officers over the phone, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. But this one little part right here, I don't recall saying that at
all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. What part is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. "Saved a lot of people some trouble."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, all right. Now, is it possible that you could have said
that to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't think I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why do you say that you don't think you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Well, I didn't hear it. I mean I heard him say this very plain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. "I hope I killed the SOB," you heard him say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you didn't hear him state, "And saved a lot of people some
trouble"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I don't recall hearing that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Would you do this? Would you take a pen and would
you put a parenthesis around from "and" to the end of that sentence, and then
would you write in there, "I don't believe I stated that," or whatever you believe
that reflects your opinion at this time? Would you initial that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And date it. It is the 25th day. Now, are there any other
changes or additions or corrections you would make on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Oh, on this, where it says, "You all know me, I am Jack Ruby,
made that several times," he didn't make the statement but once, actually and I
don't know where this "several times" came from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Was that just once in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. In other words, while you were around and near Jack Ruby,
is the only time you heard him was just one time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. One time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Why don't you cross out "several times" and write
"once"? And why don't you initial it and date it? Anything else on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No. It all seems to <span class="locked">be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. If you would, sign each of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, put it down on the same page that I have marked the
exhibit, some place where it is legible. Why don't you put it down at the bottom
of the page and date it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. All of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Well, not every page. Just every page that I have marked
as an exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Is that all now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is all that I have got.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Do you have any more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I do have one other question to ask here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMaster</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have I or any member of the Commission staff talked with you
prior to this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>. No, sir.</p>

<h2 id="HBH">TESTIMONY OF HAROLD B. HOLLY, JR.</h2>

<p>The testimony of Harold B. Holly, Jr., was taken at 8 p.m., on March 26, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Mr. Harold B. Holly, Jr. Mr. Holly, my
name is Leon D. Hubert. I am a member of the staff of the general counsel
to the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Under the authority of the Presidential Proclamation 11130, dated November 29,
1963, a joint resolution of Congress No. 137, and rules of procedure that have
been adopted by the Commission, I have been authorized to take your deposition
under oath. Now, the general nature of the inquiry of the Commission is to
ascertain the facts concerning the death of President Kennedy and the death of
Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, the inquiry is to determine what facts you know
concerning these events, or anything related to them.</p>

<p>I advise you that under the rules adopted by the Commission, you have a right
to a 3-day written notice prior to being asked to come for a deposition, but the
rules also provide that a witness may waive that right if he wishes to do so.</p>

<p>You have been asked to come because Mr. J. Lee Rankin, the general counsel
of the Commission, wrote a letter to Mr. J.&nbsp;E. Curry asking that he make you
available. But I repeat, you may either waive the 3-day notice, or if you
wish you may insist on the 3-day notice. Do you wish to waive that notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No; I would like to go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean yes, you wish to waive? You would rather go ahead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then I will ask you to stand and raise your right hand. Do
you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your full name, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Harold B. Holly, Jr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Forty-seven.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. 3429 Antilles, Mesquite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mesquite, it is not in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No; it is Mesquite, Tex., a suburb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are actually a reserve officer of the Dallas police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been connected with the reserves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Five years, going on six.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation in civilian life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. General contractor and cabinetwork.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you own your own business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes, sir. Nineteen years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In that business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I know that you performed some services as a reserve officer
on the 22d and 23d, but our inquiry now is as to the functions you performed
on the 24th, or perhaps you didn't perform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Let's say the 23d and the 24th. The assassination took place
the 23d, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. 22d and 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was a Saturday. I am asking about Sunday the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I was up here all day Saturday. Sunday, I didn't participate,
as well as I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had not anticipated being called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you, in fact, called on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I don't recall now. It is pretty vague there. The day of assassination
I was called, and the day Oswald was shot, I was called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, that was the 24th of November, a Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, how were you called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I beg your pardon, I was here Friday. Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday; I sure was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And at what time were you called on Sunday the 24th the
day Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. It was the morning. I believe it was around 9 o'clock and they
called and said for me to report downtown. They were going to try to move
him out around 2 o'clock. I immediately come to town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You got into uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes; and at the present time, I don't recall, because I got down
about 5 minutes after he was shot. I reported for duty at the entrance of the
Main Street entrance to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had already been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To whom did you speak who gave you that information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Lieutenant Kriss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you receive any assignment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes. I was assigned to direct traffic and keep traffic from bogging
down in front of the city hall entrance. And I stayed there approximately
30 minutes, and then I was reassigned out at Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you go out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. By the convenience of the city. We was hauled out in a squad
car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go out with any group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes; I went out with a group. There were five in our group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I was there approximately 3 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was with you in that group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No; I don't. I don't recall none of the names, because I wasn't
familiar with any of the boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you remember that during the time that you were
out at Parkland Hospital another reserve officer approached you and stated
that he had seen the man who shot Oswald coming down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No; he didn't approach me, because I approached him. I went
over to find where I could get some water. I was stationed where the entrance
is where the Governor was, and he told me there was some coffee and
water if I wanted, and I went in and when I came back I struck up a conversation
with the man, and we were talking <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he a reserve officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes; he was a reserve. And in the conversation he said that
he either knew or he saw Ruby down in the city hall, knew of him getting down
in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he speaking, from what you could tell, of Ruby being down
in there on the morning that Oswald was assassinated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes. I asked him&mdash;the conversation went like, well, how in
the world could they ever let him in. Everybody knew him, which most reserves
do know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You knew him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Oh, yes; I knew him. I did business with him. And I would
know him if I saw him. But I wasn't stationed down there, so therefore,
I don't know.</p>

<p>And he said he saw him down there, or did see of him, or he in someway,
one of the reserves had let him in, and he had a lapel pass on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you know who he was, this reserve?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No. I tried to go through the photographs of who I thought it
was. I never have learned if it was him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did pick out a person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the name of the man you picked out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No. Captain Solomon mentioned his name, but I don't recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does the name Newman refresh your memory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Newman? It's been so long ago. I wouldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any doubt about your identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Well, other than I described the man to him, and, of course, I
went over the photographs with Captain Solomon on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A week later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. On that following Sunday after the date. No; it was a week later.
I beg your pardon. It was a week later, and I met him up there Sunday, and
we went over the photographs with men in their uniforms, and the boy I picked
out, Captain Solomon said, "Well, that is one of the men that is down in the
basement," and that is the only one I could think it could have been.</p>

<p>And he contacted the man and the man was hunting at that time, and I never
did hear of any more of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what I mean is, the man you did pick out, is there any doubt
in your mind that you picked out the man you spoke to at the hospital who told
you he had seen Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. There is a little doubt there, yes. I wouldn't be too positive of it.
But I <span class="locked">feel&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen this man since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No; I haven't seen him since. I didn't know him and never had
seen him before that. But I am pretty positive I picked out the right man, the
one that I did see and talk to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me see if I can get you straight. You say that you are
pretty positive that you did pick out the right man, but a little while before you
said that you weren't quite sure? There is a little difference between the two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I went over several photographs with Captain Solomon and he is
the only one that resembles him.</p>

<p>The photographs he showed me were old photographs, so there was a little
doubt there, and that is the only part I can be doubted on.</p>

<p>I think he said the photographs he showed me were maybe 3 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he didn't get the man and confront you with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was this man that you saw a youngish man or middle age or
what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I would say he was in his thirties, about 37 years old or 36 years
old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he a little husky?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. He was about 165 or 170, about 5'8" or 9", and blue eyes and bald
headed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had on a cap?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Had a cap on, and didn't wear any glasses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had on a hat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Had a cap on, and didn't wear any glasses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, the way I see it, among those pictures that Captain Solomon
showed you, you picked out the man you thought was the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I still think it was the same man that Captain Solomon&mdash;he didn't
tell me prior, but after I picked him out, he said that is the only man it could
have been, because he was down in the basement, and the way I described it, it
fitted the description I had given. He did explain after it was over that the
photographs were about 3 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I think that you passed on the information that this reserve
officer had given you to someone, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. How was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You reported to someone that a reserve officer had told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did you report it to?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I reported it to the CID officer, I guess it was, down on the first
or second floor of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember who it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No; it was lieutenant someone, through one of the detectives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which detective was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Detective Eberhardt. I gave the information to one of the stenographers
up in burglary and theft division, and I typed it out and sent it on
down to the lieutenant. Offhand, I don't recall his name. It was one of the
investigators on the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you contacted to make a statement about your activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. The subject, how it come up, one of the detectives was out at the
house, and the subject came up that they were trying to find out how in the
world Ruby ever got down in the basement. And I said, "Well, my Lord, one of
the reserves let him in."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I would say that was on about a Wednesday or Thursday after
the accident. And he said, "Will you make a statement?" And I said, "I will be
glad to."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make a written statement, or was it just oral?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Oral statement and I signed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they write it up in the form of an interview, or did he write
it for your signature as a letter to the chief?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. A letter to the&mdash;it went through&mdash;I don't know what procedure it
did go through. I just don't know the hand it went into.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For the purpose of identification, we will see if we can determine
whether the written reports you have just been speaking of is one of these,
one that I have here. And also in order to get the contents of these two reports
into the record, I am going to identify them by marking the first one as "Dallas,
Tex., March 26, 1964, Exhibit No. 5109, Deposition of H.&nbsp;B. Holly, Jr.," and I am
signing my name on the margin. I notice that it has a second page with two
lines, and I am putting my initials in the lower right-hand corner.</p>

<p>The other document is a document consisting of five pages, being an interview,
or the report of an interview by two FBI agents, Mr. Dallman and Mr.
Quigley. I am marking that as "Dallas, Tex., March 26, 1964, Exhibit No.
5110, Deposition of H.&nbsp;B. Holly, Jr." I am signing my name on the first page
and putting my initials on the second, third, fourth, and fifth pages. I would
like you, Mr. Holly, if you will, please to read all these, and I want to ask
you about the correctness of each one. So I would like you to read it carefully
and after you have done so, I will ask you to make any comments you want as
to the correctness, make any changes you want, if it is not correct, because
neither of these are your own statements. This is what other people said you
said. Then I want to find out, too, if there is another report that you, yourself,
signed, because they don't purport to be signed by you. So, would you do
that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. [Reads report.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Holly, I have shown you, and I think you have read
now the exhibits which I have identified as No. 5109, being a report of an
interview of you by Jack Revill, said report being made to Chief of Police Curry
in a letter dated December 1, 1963. Does that substantially represent what you
said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is anything wrong about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. The only thing I can see wrong is, the report wasn't made right
after the assassination. It was about 5 days afterwards. That is the only
thing I can see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, of course, this doesn't say when the report was made. Oh,
you mean the report about having heard that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. To Lieutenant Revill there. I believe he corrected that, but it
wasn't made right after. Statement says that I made a statement to Sergeant
Eberhart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don't see anything in 5109 that indicates you made this report
about talking to that man the next day. As a matter of fact, I don't see where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
this report of an interview by Revill attempts to indicate the day on which
you reported that this reserve officer had said these things to you.</p>

<p>I think the other document does that. Well, let's look at 5110, which is the
FBI report of interview, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I believe it was in the FBI report there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; on the third page there is of Exhibit 5110, in the last paragraph,
there is the following language. "He relayed this information to a close
personal friend of his, Detective Gus Eberhardt, who is a regular officer assigned
to the burglary and theft bureau. He believed he told Eberhardt this on the
following day." Is that the part you think is not correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No; that is not correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. It was about the Sunday. It was about Thursday of that week,
approximately Thursday of that week, he come out to the house, and I was
going to ride with him that night, and he made the statement that he was trying
to find out as to how Ruby entered the city hall, and I said, "Well, the information
you have there I passed on to him." And he said, "Will you make
a signed statement to that effect." And I said, "I would be glad to."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you then and <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I immediately rode to the city hall and made a report, made a
statement to the secretary there in the burglary and theft division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, let me get another book and perhaps we can get that
in too.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>I am now marking for identification a document which is Commission Document
81A.48. It is apparently a copy of a letter dated November 29, 1963,
addressed to Mr. J.&nbsp;E. Curry, Chief of Police, by A.&nbsp;M. Eberhardt, Detective.
The copy seems to be signed in ink by A.&nbsp;M. Eberhardt. For identification, I
am marking that document, although I am not removing it from this file, and
"Dallas, Tex., March 26, 1964, Exhibit No. 5111, Deposition of H.&nbsp;B. Holly."
I am signing my name, Leon D. Hubert, Jr. That document consists of only one
page.</p>

<p>Now, going back for a moment to 5110, that is the FBI report, I think you
said that you had read it and that you found it correct, that it is probably
a correct record of the interview you had with the FBI agents, except that it
was in error when it stated that you had conveyed this information to Eberhart
on the day after Oswald was shot. Your recollection was that it was Thursday
of that week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This letter indicates, Exhibit 5111, indicates that that information
was passed on to Eberhardt on November 29, which I believe was a Thursday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes; I don't remember if that is dated or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is dated November 29.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. That was a Wednesday or Thursday after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The 29th or November 1963, was a Friday night. Could it have
been Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes; it could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, this Exhibit 5111, you think, is the report that you
were speaking of a little while ago in your deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes; that is the only report that I made to Detective Eberhardt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said you thought you had signed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I thought I signed that. That is the one right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Exhibit 5111 is the one you were talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you had the recollection of having signed it? Of course,
here we have only a copy of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It may be that you did sign the original, but it doesn't indicate
that there was a space for you to sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. I was thinking I signed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was no other report than this one here?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No; no other report other than the one that I talked to Lieutenant
Revill about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any other statements or comments to make concerning
any part of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No; I have covered it pretty well, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you had any interviews with any others than this deposition
today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No, sir; this is the first time I ever met or seen you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you had any interviews with any other members of the
President's Commission, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No; other than the FBI, two FBI officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am talking about persons who identified themselves as members
of the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. No; none whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir, thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holly</span>. That is all right. I am glad to be of service.</p>

<h2 id="HMK">TESTIMONY OF HARRY M. KRISS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Harry M. Kriss was taken at 7:30 p.m., on March 26, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Mr. Harry Kriss. Mr. Kriss, my name
is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff of the general counsel of
the Commission. Under the provisions of the President's Executive Order
11130, dated November 23, 1963, and the joint resolution of Congress No. 137,
and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in conformance with the
Executive order and the joint resolution, I have been authorized to take a sworn

you have appeared here tonight by virtue of a general request made by Mr. J.
Lee Rankin, general counsel of the staff of the President's Commission to
Mr. J.&nbsp;E. Curry, the chief of police, who was asked to make all of you gentlemen
available to us. Under the rules adopted by the Commission, however, you were
entitled to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of this deposition, but the

to do so. Are you willing to waive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes; I will waive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you stand so as to be sworn. Do you solemnly swear to
tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. So help me God.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Harry M. Kriss [spelling] K-r-i-s-s. M is the initial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age, please? Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Fifty-three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you reside, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. 6906 Merrilee Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. In Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are a reserve officer, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes, sir; in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation in general?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Occupation in general, manufacturer of sportswear, men's, and
manufacturer of neckwear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you a native of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long have you been in the reserve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Eleven years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now, were you called on November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the Sunday after the President's death.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. That is Sunday after&mdash;yes, sir; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were at home at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes, sir; I was getting ready to play golf. Four or five more
minutes and I'd have been gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were called to report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when you did report, did you report in uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes; surely I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, Mr. Kriss, I am showing you here two documents which
concern what you have already had to say about the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think we can save considerable time if I'll ask you to
identify these and comment upon them, but before doing so I wish to identify
them as exhibits so that we can speak of them in those terms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, on the letter, or copy of a letter dated November 26,
addressed to J.&nbsp;E. Curry, the original of which, I suppose, was signed by you,
I am marking it for identification, "Dallas, Texas, March 26, 1964, Exhibit 5106.
Deposition of H.&nbsp;M. Kriss." I will put "reserve officer." I will sign my name
to that, and I note that this Exhibit 5106 consists of one page only. The next
document is a report of an interview made December 3, 1963, with you by the
FBI Agents Wilkinson and Hardin and it consists of two pages. I am marking
the first page, "Dallas, Texas, March 26, 1964, Exhibit 5107. Deposition of
H.&nbsp;M. Kriss." Or, rather, "reserve officer", and I am signing my name on the
first page and placing my initials in the lower right-hand corner of the second
page. Now, Mr. Kriss, you have read both of these statements I believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are these substantially correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Substantially; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any additions to add to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. I can't think of any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have anything that you see that is wrong that should be
deleted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, then, in order that your testimony just now concerning
these documents may be tied into the particular documents, I would like you to
sign them so that the record will show that we are both talking about the same
documents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just write underneath my signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Well, do you have a pen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; you can use that one. Just initial the second page. Now,
sign&mdash;initial the second page on the FBI report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. You want me to sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; just sign under my name. I think there is only one point I
want to clarify about this matter. Are you familiar with the chart or map
made by the Dallas Police Department of the basement area showing the positions
of all the various officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, in the report that they have filed, the documents relative
to your statements, you are identified in that report as No. 61. As a matter of
fact, attached to the map was a key, showing that 61 was H.&nbsp;M. Kriss. It
shows, however, that you were standing, at the time of the shooting, in the
north part, I suppose it would be, on the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I notice that your statement says it was different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No; I wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Even so, to clarify that, I would like you to see what this is so
you can see what I am talking about. See your number on this key. This 61?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. 61; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you get to this map&mdash;see 61 on the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. That is the Main Street ramp. That is where I was after&mdash;it
was&mdash;that is where I placed myself when they said, "Don't let anyone out of the
basement."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. That will clarify it then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. You can see it on television. I saw it the other night again
where I ran across and when they said, "Don't let anyone out of the basement,"
that is where I placed myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that is going to explain that, and in order to make
it a matter of record, I am going to ask you to show your position before the
shooting, and your position after the shooting on this map, but first let me
identify this map by marking it, "Dallas, Tex., March 26, 1964, Exhibit No. 5108,
deposition of H.&nbsp;M. Kriss." I am signing my name to it, and I will ask you
for the purposes of identification so that the record will show that we are
both talking about the same document, to put your name right there. Now, I
would like you to look over there at the mockup. And on the mockup, determine
where you were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. That is Main Street&mdash;I was right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, let's see if we can find that on the map and mark it. It
would be right here, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No; right over here [indicating]. Wouldn't it? No, here is
the&mdash;wait a minute. Wait a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, we get at <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. This is <span class="locked">Main&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And this is Commerce Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Right. That is the jail <span class="locked">right&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Here is the position right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the Commerce Street like that? I am drawing a <span class="locked">circle&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I am drawing the line out then and I am putting, "Position
of H.&nbsp;M. Kriss."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. The <span class="locked">four&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I noticed on the large map that was attached to the Dallas
report that&mdash;and to the key to the personnel, your number was 61, and that
they had 61 in the position I am now marking in a circle. Can you tell me what
the explanation of that is, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. That is confusing, because after the shooting they hollered, "Don't
let anyone out of the basement." And I saw the truck over here, so I ran over
here and placed myself right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where this circle is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes, right; that is where I placed myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you are at this position, but it was after the
shooting instead of before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. After the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, I am placing a circle of your position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. After the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And drawing a line from it and writing "Position of H.&nbsp;M.
Kriss after the shooting."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, about how long had you been in the position you were in
before the shooting and until the shooting?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Well, we had been kind of walking over here watching the door
<span class="locked">over&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say "over <span class="locked">here"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. In the garage area. I had already put some men out here on
both sides.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had already put some men out here on both sides? Out on
the Commerce Street side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes, sir; and on the Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And on the Main Street side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. And we were told by the officers to move all the press back over
this way, keep them on this side [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you see, you have to explain what you mean by "this
side," <span class="locked">because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Well, that <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because someone reading a transcript of it later won't be able
to tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. That is the west side then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. West side of the ramp, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do I understand you to say that you had been instructed to
keep all the <span class="locked">press&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Out of the ramp area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes; against the west wall only, all the rail&mdash;the area in here,
to keep the press back over here and [indicating]&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Against the rail, or on the side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No; against the rail. If I just leave through&mdash;they were trying
to clear this up right in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had you been in the position that we have marked
"Position prior to shooting"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Possibly 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ten or fifteen minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Something along there. Prior to that time, is when I had been
walking right back in here [indicating]. Yes; and standing, I believe standing
right over in here is where I placed myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. I will put another circle and I am going to mark
that "Position of H.&nbsp;M. Kriss <span class="locked">prior"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. <span class="locked">"To&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. "Shooting."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Before being told to move the press on this side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. "Position of H.&nbsp;M. Kriss <span class="locked">prior"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Now, we have not&mdash;this is the west side. That is the east side&mdash;"of being
told to keep the press back." In other words, your first position was really the
<span class="locked">position&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Right here. That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let's put a number&mdash;No. "1" in it. That was your first
position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your second <span class="locked">position&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No. "2."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As No. "2." "Position of H.&nbsp;M. Kriss prior to shooting."
And No. "3" is your position after the shooting? Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. That's it; sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you say that you had been in position No. "2" for about
10 minutes or so before they brought Oswald down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which way were you facing then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. This way [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Facing north?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Facing north; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you see anything up there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No; all I saw was officers standing right at the head of this&mdash;this
officer right there. With a shotgun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he is a regular?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No reserves were armed. We are all unarmed. Unarmed and
we don't carry arms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in looking from your position No. "2." Up the ramp,
were there&mdash;can you tell us whether there were a lot of people standing in
that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No; I didn't. I was just&mdash;had lots of people right in this area,
right about here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were talking about that northeast position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes, sir; all this area right in here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And where the down ramp <span class="locked">going&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. All this area right on this side. That is where they were all
standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you can't say "this side," sir. While I understand <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. The east side. The east side, excuse me. The east side. I keep
forgetting she's taking it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were all standing up against the rail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right by the television cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Right; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then the ramp going from the basement down into the
parking area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And further along toward Commerce Street along that rail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes; there was a truck there, large truck here and another car
pulled up right behind the armored truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Both on the Commerce Street side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Directing your attention again to whether there were a great
number of people in an area that I am now marking with an oblong and going
to call it "area A," <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. That area there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Well, I couldn't be for sure, but it seemed that large amount
people all around there and in here, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice an automobile being driven out of there just a
few seconds or <span class="locked">minutes&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. I can't recall that. I have tried to remember that and I can't
recall that. No; I can't recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't recall it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No; I can remember something vaguely. I can remember doing
something&mdash;they were moving a car, but I was mostly interested in watching
the press, keeping everyone here. That was my job, keeping everyone on the
east side of the rail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand, and you were looking more at the press than at the
Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. That's correct; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see this man when he came down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No; I didn't see&mdash;all I saw was just a blur right in here [indicating].
I didn't see&mdash;I was like everyone else, I was waiting here, and Oswald
was right here [indicating], and that is where I looked at Oswald, and I was
a curiosity seeker, I think, when I should have been watching&mdash;I was&mdash;learned
my lesson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Like everyone else, everyone else was watching that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, your attention was on Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you saw a blur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize the man at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Right then? No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you known Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Known, of him, saw him before in the papers and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Well, they said&mdash;somebody said, "Don't let anyone out of the
basement." And I ran across here and I thought I saw one of the captains,
Arnett, and I saw him going down, and he was in the confusion and in that
confusion here, and ran over there and saw that everything was all right, and
they said, "Don't let anyone out."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you positioned yourself right in the middle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. Positioned myself in the middle and no one passed thereafter.
That I can assure you of. That is the only thing I do know for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Let me see if there's anything else.</p>

<p>All right. Is there anything else you would like to add that is not contained
in the statement, or in your testimony today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No, sir; I just don't know a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right for now. Have you ever been interviewed by any member
of the Commission's staff prior to today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No; only the FBI is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have never been interviewed by me prior to this deposition
today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kriss</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. I think that is all and I certainly thank you very
much.</p>

<h2 id="RLL">TESTIMONY OF ROY LEE LOWERY</h2>

<p>The testimony of Roy Lee Lowery was taken at 11 a.m., on March 25, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Detective R.&nbsp;L. Lowery, Dallas Police

the facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent

a witness may waive that 3-day notice if he wishes to do so. Do you wish
to waive the 3-day notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I will waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Roy Lee Lowery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Thirty-two years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. 838 West Church in Grand Prairie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that just outside of the Dallas area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Yes, sir; it is in Dallas County. It is on the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I am a detective with the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so occupied?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Oh, approximately 9½ years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What specific position do you hold in the detective department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I'm a detective in the juvenile bureau of the police department,
criminal division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is your immediate superior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Capt. Frank Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is next up the line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I believe it is M.&nbsp;W. Stevenson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then Chief Batchelor and Chief Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I think you have <span class="locked">read&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Now, if you will start with Mr. <span class="locked">Bookhout's&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me get this report in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have read three documents which I have previously
handed you to read, and I want to mark the three of them now for identification,
and then we will talk about each one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am marking a letter, or a copy of a letter consisting of one
page, addressed to Chief Curry, dated November 24, 1963, indicating that the
original may be signed by you, and I am identifying it as follows, by marking
upon it, "Dallas, Tex., March 25, 1964. Exhibit No. 5081. Deposition of R.&nbsp;L.
Lowery, and signing my name below it." As to the second document, consisting
of two pages, and purporting to be a report of an interview by&mdash;of you by
FBI Agent Bookhout, on November 24, 1963, and I am marking that document
along the right margin as follows: "Dallas, Tex., March 25, 1964. Exhibit
5082. Deposition of R.&nbsp;L. Lowery." I am signing my name below that on
the first page of that document, and placing my initials in the right-hand lower
corner on the second page of that document. Finally a document purporting
to be a report of an interview of you by FBI Agents Smith and Chapoton, on
December 23, 1963, consisting of five pages, marking the first page as follows,
to wit: "Dallas, Tex., March 25, 1964. Exhibit No. 5083, deposition of R.&nbsp;L.
Lowery," and I am signing my name on the first page, and placing my initials
in the lower right-hand corner on the second page, third page, fourth page
and the fifth page.</p>

<p>Now, sir, I hand you the exhibit which has been marked 5081, being the letter
to Chief Curry, and ask you if that letter is correct insofar as it goes? Or do
you have any other comments to make about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. This is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I hand you an exhibit identified as 5082, consisting of
two pages, and ask you if you have read it, and whether you have any comments
to make about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Yes, sir; I read it. Now, as to this one there is some changes
to be made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, I suggest you do this. If you want to make a
change in a sentence, read that sentence indicating that you are beginning to
read by using the word "quote", and when you get to the end of the sentence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
"unquote". Then make your comment about the sentence, or if you have the
whole paragraph you may do it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Well, first one, quote <span class="locked">Lowery&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is on the first page, is it not? What paragraph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. First page, first paragraph interview by Mr. Bookhout of the
FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are going to start reading, so say "quote".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Quote, "Lowery stated he and several others grabbed Ruby,"
unquote. Now, I didn't&mdash;I didn't grab Ruby. Several other officers did. I
didn't touch Ruby at all at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell this <span class="locked">man&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is incorrect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I do not recall&mdash;no, I touched Ruby later, but not at this
particular time. This is the time where Ruby was disarmed and taken into the
jail office. I didn't touch him at all at that particular time. There were
several other officers around him. I couldn't even get to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you touch him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. He was carried into the jail office by several officers, and after
coming into the jail office by myself, I held one of Jack Ruby's legs while he
was given a quick shakedown before he was taken upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Have you any other comments to make about that
Exhibit 5082?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I don't believe that there is any others on this one. Yes. On
Page 2, of this same exhibit&mdash;let's see, where could I start. Now, would you
like me to start in the middle of a sentence, or just read the whole sentence
even though it is several lines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Perhaps you'd better read the whole sentence, I think it will
be clearer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. All right, quote "He stated this camera was never put into
operation, the cable was never connected and the blank cap was never taken
off. Lowery stated that the following&mdash;that following the shooting, the action
of the two cameramen who had pushed the camera from the area was brought
to the attention of Lt. R.&nbsp;E. Swain, and they were taken to homicide and robbery
bureau for questioning." unquote. The facts are, are that the cameramen were
not taken to homicide and robbery bureau. I accompanied those men up on the
third floor where they were allowed to set up their long range camera, and
I stayed with those people for approximately an hour to an hour and a half
until I contacted Lieutenant Baker in the homicide division and told him the
reason that I was with those people, and he advised me to take their names and
addresses, business address and business phone, and home phone number, and
that it wouldn't be necessary to stay with them any longer. I took this information
and turned it in to Lieutenant Baker and released the cameramen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anything else you wish to say about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I don't believe there is any other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 5082. Anything other about 5082?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. No, that is&mdash;nothing further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As to Exhibit 5083, I ask you if it is correct, do you have any
changes or suggestions, or comments to make about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. On page 1, paragraph 2&mdash;let's see, "The contingent from the
juvenile bureau consisted of Captain Martin, Lt. George Butler, Detective
W.&nbsp;J. Cutchshaw, Detective L.&nbsp;B. Miller, Detective Charles Goolsby, Patrolman
W.&nbsp;J. Harrison and myself, Lowery."</p>

<p>The facts are that Captain Martin, Lt. George Butler, Detective W.&nbsp;J.
Cutchshaw, Detective L.&nbsp;B. Miller, Detective Charles Goolsby went from the
third&mdash;juvenile bureau, on the third floor, room 314, city hall, down the elevator
to the basement of the city hall. As we came off the elevator we met Patrolman
W.&nbsp;J. Harrison coming up the hall from the police locker room, and he accompanied
us to the location in the basement where Oswald was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say, "city hall," you mean the police department
building, not the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. No, sir. Police and courts building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, any further comments about Exhibit 5083?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Now, I have one change here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On what page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. On page 2, paragraph 3. Now, this is the only thing, the only
change is&mdash;I don't know whether it is necessary for me to read the whole thing&mdash;is
the TV station WPAB. In this report it says, "WPAB".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is a <span class="locked">typographical&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. It is wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, that's correct, and now, I don't think we have to do anything
more about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. All right. Then, on page 2 in&mdash;let's see, this page 2, paragraph
4, and this will carry on to paragraph 1 of page 3. All right. "This police
car had its red lights on, flashing, and there were two or three officers in the car."</p>

<p>That is a mistake. The facts are is this police car was a marked squad car,
occupied by one officer, and that officer was Officer O'Dell, who is a patrolman,
and as far as I can say, he was alone in the car. Only person in the car. All
right. On page 3, this also is in paragraph 1. "He did not know who this
individual was until his hat fell off in the melee and he saw it was Jack Ruby
whom he has known for several years."</p>

<p>The facts are that at approximately the same instant the shot was fired, or
within a fraction of a second thereafter, I did recognize the person firing the
shot as being Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The correction there being that you recognized him before his
hat fell off, is that what you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Well, I couldn't definitely say that I recognized him before
his hat fell off. I <span class="locked">don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize him before he fired the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Well, it seemed like to me at the same time. Now, of course,
this happened directly in front of me, closer than&mdash;about half of the distance
between the two of us <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that the witness indicates the distance that
I would judge to be approximately 6 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Well, he would be within 4 feet, I think. That Jack Ruby
would be within 4 feet of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say that the distance that I judge is 6 feet, you
think is about two-thirds of that distance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. That's right. Three to 4 feet, and I couldn't say that Jack
Ruby's hat&mdash;I couldn't say whether the hat had fallen off or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>All right. Now, you have looked over the other pages of 5083, and handed
it back to me, are there any corrections or deletions or&mdash;wrong statements or
anything that you would like to comment upon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Best I can remember the rest of it is fairly accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I want to have you identify a chart of the basement area
of the Dallas Police Department and I am marking upon it for the purposes
of identification the words, "Dallas, Tex., March 25, 1964. Exhibit Number
5084, deposition of R.&nbsp;L. Lowery." And I am signing my name below that, and
just for the purposes of identification, I wish you would sign your name below
it, too, below my name.</p>

<p>I would like you to look at the mockup here and&mdash;if you will come over here
with me, we can put the chart and the mockup together, and I would like you
to&mdash;by using the mockup, point to the place on the mockup where you were
standing and then we will mark it on the map.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. All right. I was standing exactly at this point here [indicating].
In fact, the corner&mdash;I was leaning back against the corner, and I could
feel it exactly between my shoulder blades.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, I am marking a circle right here as the point
that you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Yes, sir; and that would be on the southwest corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Southwest corner of the intersection of the jail corridor and
the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am marking a circle around the position you have indicated
and I am writing the words, "Position of R.&nbsp;L. Lowery at the time of the shooting,"
which I am also placing in a circle. Now, is that correct, sir? That was
your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, how long had you been in that position prior to the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Well, I couldn't definitely say how long I had been at that one
particular position. I had been in this area for, oh, from approximately 10
minutes. I had been within a few feet of there. I just took this position a few
minutes, and&mdash;or maybe a couple of minutes before the shooting actually took
place, but I was standing within a few feet of that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the moment of the shooting, you were in precisely that
position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you would judge you had been in that position about 2
minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I don't believe it would be any more than 2 minutes' time. I
don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were facing then in the general direction of the TV cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Well, when the actual shooting took place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the time before that? I want to get both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Well, I looked both ways, both left and right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I'll ask you if you scanned the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Well, in the direction of the TV cameras, the lights were so
bright I couldn't have seen any people in the crowd. I could see forms, but I
couldn't&mdash;I wouldn't be able <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a detective, W.&nbsp;J. Harrison, I think he is called
"Blackie" Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he in your line of vision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I saw him shortly before the shooting. Now, at the time all
the TV lights and everything were turned on, I don't recall seeing "Blackie" from
that time until the shot was actually fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wonder if you would use the mockup first to place the position,
approximately, of Harrison, the last time you were able to see him, and then
translate that by placing a circle on the map <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Let me get squared away here. He would have been in this
general area. I couldn't say in relation to this wall&mdash;to this guardrail. I would
think they would have been <span class="locked">approximately&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I am going to mark a line, which I am labeling as line
"A, B," and then I want to ask you to take the pen and put the approximate
position of Harrison the last time you saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Well, I would say about this [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have made an "X," and I am putting a circle about the
"X," and drawing a line out and writing the following, "position of W.&nbsp;J. Harrison&mdash;"
the approximate position, is that what you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. "The approximate position of W.&nbsp;J. Harrison when last seen by
Lowery."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. <span class="locked">Before&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. "Before the shooting." Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am encircling that language and connecting it with the position
marked "X." Now, can you give us any estimation of how long before the
shooting was the last time that you saw Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. No, sir; I wouldn't make an attempt, because the time in my
estimation I found that they were so far off that I couldn't&mdash;I just don't have
any idea. It couldn't have been more than a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; you did not see him after that, though, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I saw him after the shooting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I mean after that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. As far as I remember, no, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you attribute your failure to see him to the fact that the
TV lights had been turned on after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Well, the TV lights were so bright. I don't remember seeing
Harrison, but I don't say that I was completely blinded by the TV lights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Ruby come up from the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Ruby come out from the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. The first time I saw Ruby he was lunging, and almost instantaneously
the shot was fired, and I couldn't&mdash;I couldn't say that I saw him come
from the crowd. I saw a blur, and about this time the shot was fired, and there
is Jack Ruby right in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What side of "Blackie" Harrison did Ruby come from with relation
to Harrison himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I couldn't say which side <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't know whether it was on Harrison's left side or right
side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the automobile that went up the ramp just
before the shooting that had a flashing red light on top of it and two or three
officers in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Well, now, that is one of the statements we changed. I remember
the marked squad car being driven with Officer O'Dell going up the&mdash;oh, we
call it the north ramp, the wrong way, which&mdash;with his red lights on, but this
car only had the one officer in it, the best I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Rio Pierce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him drive a car up that ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I will say that between the time that Officer O'Dell went up the
north ramp, I couldn't tell you in minutes or seconds how much time had elapsed,
but there was a plain car, and I believe it was driven by Lieutenant Pierce,
and he had a couple or three other officers. I couldn't say exactly how many
officers were in the car, but it did go up the ramp with red lights on going up the
north ramp to the Main Street entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was after O'Dell had passed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Yes, sir; best I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that the statement&mdash;I would ask you to have another look at
the statement, which is Exhibit 5083, and ask you if it is the statement that
you previously corrected so that it would refer to O'Dell. Isn't it, in fact,
correct insofar as it would deal with what you have just said about Pierce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Now, here is the statement we changed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see your point, and that is that the O'Dell car did not have a
red light on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Yes, sir, it did, but the O'Dell was&mdash;the O'Dell car was a marked
squad car, and that was the change that we made. This O'Dell's car was the first
car to go up the ramp, and he was&mdash;there was only one person in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, then, there was another marked <span class="locked">car&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. There was an unmarked car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was an unmarked car, and that is Pierce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Pierce was the unmarked car, and he had another officer in the
car. I couldn't tell you who, or how many, or who they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the time interval between the O'Dell car movements
up that ramp and Pierce's movements up that ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I couldn't&mdash;I couldn't&mdash;I'd be afraid to say exactly, but probably
wasn't more than a minute in that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you follow the car, or the Pierce car up the ramp with your
eyes, I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. No, sir; if you will notice this [indicating] there is an offset
here, and from my position here I would only see a short distance up the
ramp, and there is also a drop down, air-conditioning and central-heating unit
back in here that I would&mdash;if my view hadn't been obstructed by the line of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
on that side I wouldn't have been able to see more than a few feet up the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see anybody coming down? I understand from your
statement that you could not have seen their faces as they came down the
ramp because of the obstruction, but you could have seen feet, couldn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. I wouldn't be able to. I didn't see anybody come down the ramp.
They could have possibly gotten down there without me seeing them, but I didn't
see any feet, or any person come down the ramp at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see anybody climb over the rails from the parking area
into the ramp on the Main Street side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. No, sir; not that I remember. I couldn't see&mdash;couldn't see the
rail from my position for the line of photographers and officers and the TV
cameras and lights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have occasion to talk to Ruby thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Which point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Well, as I told you, the officers took him into the jail office, and
I went into the jail office, and they were in the process of searching him, and
he was struggling, and I held one&mdash;I believe his left leg. Had him down on his
back, and I held his left leg while he was doing a quick shakedown and then
he was taken to the elevator and upstairs, and that is the last that I saw of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Detective Lowery, have you anything else that you
would like to add that you have not stated, or is not contained in these several
exhibits we have identified here today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Well, I think they&mdash;I haven't been through the police report, the
investigation in the police department made by Captain Jones. I believe that
they had&mdash;a little more in detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are referring, I think, to a document contained in Commission's
report 81-A, that is page 66, consisting of two pages and entitled, "Investigation
of Operational Security Involving the transfer of Lee Harvey
Oswald, November 24, 1963," which was supplied to the Commission by the
Dallas Police Department through the attorney general.</p>

<p>Since I do not have an extra copy of this document, I am going to allow it to
remain in the volume, but I am going to mark it for identification as I have
marked the others, and that is, "Dallas, Texas, March 25, 1964, exhibit Number
5085," which purports to be an interview of you. Now wait&mdash;I'll finish the
identification, 5085, deposition of R.&nbsp;L. Lowery, signing my name on the first
sheet and placing my initials in the lower right-hand corner on the second sheet.
This is an interview of R.&nbsp;L. Lowery, November 29, 1963, by Lt. P.&nbsp;G. McCaghren
and Lt. C.&nbsp;C. Wallace. I think you have read this document, have you not, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. Let me brush through it right quick. I <span class="locked">don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Referring to Exhibit 5085, do you now say that it is
correct? Are there any changes you want to suggest, modifications to make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. It is correct, as far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Anything else you want to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. No, sir; I believe <span class="locked">that's&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, have you been interviewed prior to the taking of the deposition
by any member of the Commission? I don't think there was any interview
between you and me before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lowery</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="FMM">TESTIMONY OF CAPT. FRANK M. MARTIN</h2>

<p>The testimony of Capt. Frank Martin was taken at 2 p.m., on March 24, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Capt. Frank M. Martin of the juvenile
division, Dallas Police Department. Captain Martin, my name is Leon D.
Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff of the general counsel of the
President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. Under
the provisions of Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963, the joint
resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission
in conformance with the Executive order and the joint resolution, I have
been authorized by the Commission to take the sworn deposition of you, Captain
Martin.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I state to you that the general nature of the Commission's inquiry
is to ascertain, evaluate and report upon the facts relating to the assassination
of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey
Oswald. In particular to you, Captain Martin, the nature of the inquiry is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent
facts that you may know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; Captain Martin, do&mdash;you have appeared here by virtue of a
general request made by the general counsel on the staff of the President's
Commission, Mr. J. Lee Rankin, to Chief Curry. Under the rules adopted by the
Commission, you are entitled to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of
this deposition, that the rules adopted by the Commission also provide that a
witness may waive the 3-day written notice. Do you wish to waive that notice?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, will you rise and raise your right hand and I will now swear
you. Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. State your full name, Captain Martin.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Frank M. Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age, please?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Fifty-four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. 906 West Five Mile Parkway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation today, and how long have you been
in that occupation?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I am a police officer in Dallas. I have been in it for 30
years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your rank is what now?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Captain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you held the rank of captain, sir?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Since 1951, about 13 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What are your particular duties with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I have charge of the juvenile bureau. We handle all juvenile
affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, captain, I have two documents here which I am going to
mark for identification and then I will question you concerning them. Now, I
am marking this document March 24, 1963, addressed to Chief J.&nbsp;E. Curry, the
original of which apparently was signed by you. Marking this as follows, to
wit: "Dallas, Texas, March 24, 1964. Exhibit No. 5058, deposition of Capt. F.&nbsp;M.
Martin, and I'm signing my name to that document which consists of one page,
and I'm also marking another document which apparently is the report of an
interview of you, Captain Martin, by Special Agents of the FBI, to wit: Alvin J.
Zimmerman and Joseph G. Peden, on December 2nd, 1963." The document
consists of one full page, marking the first page as follows, to wit: "Dallas, Texas,
March 24, 1964. Exhibit 5059. Deposition of F.&nbsp;M. Martin." Signing my
name on that. I am placing my initials on the second page of that document
in the lower right-hand corner. Now, Captain, I believe that you have only
recently, that is to say, about 2 or 3 hours ago, had occasion to read both of these
documents?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 5058 and 5059. I now ask you if those documents represent
the truth, or whether there are any modifications or deletions or <span class="locked">additions&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, of course, <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That you would like to make in it?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. This "Miller," they have there once, where it should be
my name in the first paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you are speaking of the third line, the first page of
Exhibit 5059, where the second sentence starts, "Capt. Miller," and apparently
the sense of it would be, that since they are speaking of you, it would be "Capt.
Martin," is that right?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am, therefore, going to circle the word "Miller," and&mdash;with
a circle, and an extension line indicates that it had been changed by putting
my initial on it, and I am going to ask you at a later time to put your initials on
it, too.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than that, that document speaks the truth, as far as you
know?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. There is one area in there in the ramps that I don't
quite understand. Did he mean the ramp, or does he mean the door into the
building, the corridor door <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, then, I think you are speaking of the second to the last
sentence in the last paragraph on the first page of Exhibit 5059, sentence which
reads as follows, to wit: "He advised that auxiliary officers were stationed at
each ramp."</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. "And that to his north, this was the only entrance to the compound
which Ruby could have used." Now, what is it that you would like to
say about that, sir?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. There is a double door going into this basement at the city
hall which I wouldn't consider a ramp. They never considered it that. I don't
know, but it is more or less a corridor, or hallway going into the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is a corridor, you say, that leads from the jail building
into the basement area?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It is from the garage area into the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, did you make any statement to them about auxiliary
officers being stationed at any place?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. Yes; I told them that there were, but I meant the
two ramps coming into the basement from the outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. In other words, what you want to clarify about this
is that what you meant when you made reference to auxiliary officers and ramps,
that you meant the entrances or exits at the street level of the Main and Commerce
ramps?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And, you did not have reference to the officers at other passageways?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. I might ask you in connection with that same thing,
what do you mean by the word "compound"?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I didn't use that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn't use that word?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No; that must be theirs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you understand there, because the report is that you
said "That this was the only entrance into the compound which Ruby could
have used"?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I didn't use that word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did you express any such thought and if so, what were
you referring to?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Of course, what they are referring to by "compound," is
the area right outside the jail door there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean what is commonly called the basement area including
the parking area, the garage area, the two ramps and the space between the
two ramps?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I am sure it is, because I didn't use the word "compound."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let's look at it this way, would this statement be correct then
if we changed the word "compound," to be defined as the general basement
area as I just defined it a moment ago?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, then it would be correct to say that, to your knowledge, the
two ramps, to wit, those&mdash;the one leading from Main Street, and the one leading
from Commerce Street were the only entrances to the basement area, as we
defined it a moment ago, that Ruby could have used?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. More that he could have used, yes; but, of course, <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, this says the only entrance, and if you wish to qualify
<span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. We were speaking of these two ramps. And we were talking
of him coming down into the basement off the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Of course, you have got the city hall. I mean, the police
and courts building, and also got the city hall. He could have been&mdash;come down
the elevator over here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I take it you want to modify this statement then so that your
present opinion is that it is not correct to say that the Main Street and the Commerce
Street entrances were the only mode of entrance to the basement?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, no; there are other ways to get in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what I mean. What other ways are there?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. There is&mdash;coming from the police and courts building to
the basement, or you can come down the elevator in the city hall into the garage
area and come across, but as far as I remember, that wasn't brought up. They
were speaking of those two ramps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let me ask you this: Was the explanation that we have
now put into the record, are you satisfied that this document, 5059, is substantially
correct?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know exactly what he means here by "He knew of
no unauthorized persons to be in the basement."</p>

<p>I don't know <span class="locked">what&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, sir; if you wish to modify that in any way so that we now
know what you are thinking is about it. I ask you to please do so.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't quite&mdash;that is not very clear to me, "He knew of no
unauthorized persons permitted to be in the basement."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me get at it this way. Do you know what security precautions
were being taken to be sure that unauthorized persons were not in the
basement?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; they had men at the top of both of the outside ramps,
and I presume that they were supposed to stop anybody coming in, but apparently
they didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know what was meant by "unauthorized persons"?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, there were so many people down there. The press,
TV, radio. Of course, all had been checked before they came in. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you receive any specific instructions, yourself, as to checking?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I didn't receive any instructions at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know, or was there anything told to you whereby you
could recognize an unauthorized person?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Nothing was said. Of course, if I'd had seen Jack Ruby, I'd
have known him. I've known him for a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did any of the people have identifying badges or anything of
that sort?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No; so far as I know, they didn't. In fact, there was nothing&mdash;there
was nothing said about who was to be down there and who wasn't.
There was nothing said about anything&mdash;I didn't know anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, when did you come on duty that day, sir?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That morning, it was my Sunday to work, 8:15.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you have anything to do with the planning of the
movement of Oswald?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any knowledge as to what the plan was?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I knew nothing. I just went down there. That's about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you ordered to go down?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Chief Stevenson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time, sir?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Oh, I would say between 10:30 and 10:45, somewhere
around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Chief Stevenson is your immediate superior?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he instruct you to do?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Just to go to the basement is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give you any specific duty to perform?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you got there, what time was it?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't recall. It was a few minutes before 11, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I just got out there by the ramp and just stood there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stand before the actual shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I imagine I was down there 20 or 25 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I'm going to mark a chart. A chart of the basement area, as
follows, to wit: "Dallas, Texas, March 24, Exhibit 5060, deposition of Capt. F.&nbsp;M.
Martin." Signing it with my own name. Now, I would like to ask you, Captain,
if you could sign the other three documents just below my name, that is to
say, 5058 and 5059. Please initial a second page of 5058, below my initial and
then sign 5059. I will ask you to sign for the purposes of identification under
my name the document 5060. Now, Captain, it may be that you will want to
look at this mockup here of the basement area, and then we will enter it on
the map, but if you could show us where you stood on the mockup here, from the
time you got down there at about 11, I think, until Oswald was shot, and you
say you did not move around?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I wasn't in one spot all this time, but when he came out,
of course, there was a car sitting right&mdash;I guess the back end of the car was
coming to about here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now, you are showing the back end of the car, and
I am going to, with a pen draw in on Exhibit 5060, the approximate position
of the back end of the car as you demonstrated it.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Be about right there [indicating]. No; not that far.
About right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About like so?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I have drawn on the map a rough image of a car, by using
simply a square, and I have marked it "car". Now, would you take the pen,
sir, and&mdash;your own pen, and mark by the use of a circle your position with
reference to the car at the time of the shooting. Now, let's get that.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I was about right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, would you just write in your own handwriting there, "The
position of F.&nbsp;M. Martin at the time of the shooting." Now, Captain, you think
you&mdash;you said you had been in that general basement area for about 20 minutes
prior to the shooting?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I would say that. I don't know for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see anybody you knew?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, most of the press I knew. No one outside of the
press that I knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did know Jack Ruby, I understand?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; I knew Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think, that is already in report?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; it is in here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not until after the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you looking at any time in the direction where you subsequently
learned or believed he came from?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No; not directly. Of course&mdash;Where is your map? I couldn't
have seen him from&mdash;if I would have been, because there were people all along
here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, to your right, is that right?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; across here [indicating]. And all up in here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There were people between&mdash;on your right, between you <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many people were there in that general area?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I just would have to make an estimate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I would say between me and where he was, there was 8 or
10 people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I'm going to mark off an area in the Main Street ramp by just
drawing with a pencil a square, and putting, "Area A," in it and I will ask
you if you can tell us in the "Area A," marked on this map, what were the
conditions with respect to the number of people and so forth. Not exactly.
I know you didn't count heads, but just how crowded were the conditions?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. As well as I can remember there weren't too many people up
in that&mdash;up that far. There were 2 or 3 cars parked in the ramp there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean in the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Now, wait a minute. You have got Main <span class="locked">Street&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I marked this as "Area A," on Main Street?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, no; across this ramp there, there was quite a number
of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is in the space I have marked "Area A"?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Roughly how many people?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Oh, I'd say 15 or 20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were they standing shoulder to shoulder?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; more or less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many ranks deep would you think?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, would you regard it as a crowd?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; I would. Mostly the press. There were some officers
in that area also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think this Officer Harrison <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, yes; he&mdash;he is one of my men. He was standing, oh,
just about at the edge of the ramp there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you mark on the map by the use of a circle where you
think Harrison was at the time?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Harrison was about right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is at the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you just extend this with a little line and then write out,
"Position of"&mdash;what are his initials? W. J.?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. W. J.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Captain Martin, let me see if I can get something clear.
Was Detective Harrison in front of Oswald, or to one or the other sides of him?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. This happened so fast it is really hard to tell.</p>

<p>Of course, Oswald and the two officers came out this door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the jail door?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When they got just about, oh, 2 or 3 feet from Harrison, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
was a movement over here [indicating]. I couldn't tell what it was. I could
tell there was a movement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By "over here," you <span class="locked">mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. On the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What side of the ramp? The basement&mdash;the garage?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The garage. The garage side. Evidently Ruby was standing
right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you say "here," you'd better put a mark and put a
little arrow to it, your best recollection as to where Ruby must have been. You
didn't see Ruby?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, no; this is just supposition. He had to be right in here
somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, just put a mark and a line and indicate where
he was.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I didn't see him, but he had to be right there [indicating].
There is no question about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did see someone come from that position?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It was a movement. I didn't see anybody, but there was
a movement in there that I could detect, and then the shot was fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you write here?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. "Ruby before the shooting." Or, "immediately before."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, just tell us what you observed?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, as soon as the shot was fired, of course, it dumbfounded
me, and I tried to get through the people there on my right, to get over there
to it, and there was a lot of confusion in there, and I had trouble getting through
the press, and when I did get through they had already taken Ruby into the
jail office and Oswald was also in the jail office. Ruby was down on the floor
just inside the jail, and Oswald was lying on the north side of the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, when Oswald first came out of the jail office with
Graves and Leavelle, were you looking at him?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I saw him come out. Now, whether it was&mdash;it was shortly
after they come out&mdash;I saw him after the shot was fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were looking towards him?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; I thought they were coming all around me and go up
by me and go up to the armored car, that is what I had in mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were not aware that the plans had been changed so that
they&mdash;he was going to be taken in a police car, rather than in the armored car?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No; I didn't know anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, did you know anything about the route that was going to
be used?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, as far as I knew, they were going to put him in the
armored truck. That is the reason I was standing there, because I figured
they would come right back there and I could go up there with them, but they
didn't ever make it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe what other officers were doing, or in what
direction they were looking about the time that Oswald came out?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No; I didn't personally observe it, except on TV later. At
the time I didn't notice them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, at the time that Oswald came out, you were
looking where&mdash;you were looking towards Oswald, and if I understand it, you
are not in a position to tell us now what other people were doing except what
you saw later on television, is that right?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now do you have, any comment about what you saw on&mdash;later
on television?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, it seems that all the officers were watching Oswald
when they should have been watching the crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, that impression you formed by looking at the television
coverage of it?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And, you did not form that impression at the time the shot was
fired?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No; I hadn't noticed them then. In fact, I was over where
I couldn't see them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was the first time that you did recognize Ruby as the man
who shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. When I went in the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't know it until then?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No; I saw him on the floor. Then I heard somebody say it
was Jack Ruby, and I went in there and saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say anything to you?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear him say anything at all?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. There was so much going on, I don't know whether he said
anything or not. First thing I heard was somebody said, "He has been shot."
And then there was confusion. I don't know who said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have occasion to talk to Ruby at any time thereafter?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Captain Martin, is there anything else you would like to
say concerning any aspect of this matter at all?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I&mdash;don't take this down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, if you don't want to say it on the record, you'd better not
say it at all.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. There is a lot to be said, but probably be better if I don't
say it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I don't know what you mean <span class="locked">by&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That it would be better. What we are seeking to find out is the
facts on it.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If what you have to say is more or less a matter of opinion, that
is one thing. I don't want to ask you to express your opinion, but any facts
you know that you think might bear upon this matter, I would ask that you
state those facts.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, there is not but one thing that I could say about the
whole business. Of course, we are not experienced in handling this sort of a
prisoner. I don't guess anybody is, as far as that goes, but the way I saw it,
there was no organization at all. I didn't know who was in charge or anything
about it. I don't guess anybody&mdash;either people should have been told something&mdash;what
to do and what to expect. We <span class="locked">weren't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Have you any other facts that you think have any
bearing <span class="locked">upon&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, no; I don't think so. I think it is more or less in that
report there [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, you are talking about the documents you have
identified?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, other than the interview that I had with you this morning,
have you been interviewed by any member of the Commission staff?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, but I did interview you this morning just prior to lunch,
I think at which time we arranged for you to come to have your deposition taken.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you perceive at the present time any inconsistency between
the interview with me this morning and your testimony in the deposition this
afternoon?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, no. It is about the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you state anything, or provide any material, state any facts
in the course of the interview this morning which has not been developed in the
record this afternoon?</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't recall anything. If there is any you can think of,
you can ask me and I will bring it out, but I don't recall a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, sir; I don't. I am just obliged to ask these questions to wrap
it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We certainly thank you, Captain Martin, and I thank you personally
and on behalf of the Commission for your cooperation in this matter.
If at any time, if you know that there are some other facts that you may have
overlooked, please feel completely free to get in touch with us so that we may
find out what that fact may be. In other words, it is never too late to reveal
a fact which has been omitted as a lapse of memory.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know of a thing right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="BJM">TESTIMONY OF BILLY JOE MAXEY</h2>

<p>The testimony of Billy Joe Maxey was taken at 9:30 p.m., on March 25, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. Attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of&mdash;is that Billy Joe Maxey? It is not
William?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Billy Joe Maxey?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. My name is Leon D. Hubert. I am a member of the advisory

Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, a joint resolution of Congress
No. 137, and the rules and procedures adopted by the Commission in conformance
with the Executive order and the joint resolution, I have been authorized to take
a sworn deposition from you, Mr. Maxey. I state to you now that the general
nature of the Commission's inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate and report upon
the facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent
violent death of Lee H. Oswald. In particular as to you, Mr. Maxey, the nature
of the inquiry today is to determine the facts you know about the death of
Oswald and any other pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry.
Mr. Maxey, you appeared here by virtue of a general request made by J. Lee
Rankin, general counsel of the Staff of the President's Commission, and under
the rules adopted by the Commission for the taking of these depositions, you
are entitled to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of the deposition. But
the rules also provide that a witness may waive this. I now ask if you are willing
to waive it?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Please state your full name.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Billy Joe Maxey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your age?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Thirty-three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you reside, sir?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. 8912 Freeport Drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That in Dallas?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Field sergeant, Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been with the Police Department?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Nine years, and approximately a half. Since September 20th,
1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your assignment today?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Field sergeant, patrol division.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the same assignment that you had during the period of
November 22 and 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Yes, sir. I was acting lieutenant on that particular day.
Number 16.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What does that mean, "Number 16"?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. That is the call from the northeast substation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any particular orders or functions with respect
to the transfer of Oswald to the county jail?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No, sir; not before I arrived at the central station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you arrive there?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Somewhere in the vicinity of 11 a.m. I am not positive of
the exact time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of an automobile were you driving then?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. A plain car, black 1963 model Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, unmarked?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you coming from?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Northeast substation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been ordered in?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you come to get there then?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. I had some cards to be taken to 511, where there were
requests for off-duty employment, overtime work and I thought perhaps I might
be able to assist them. I knew they were going to need all the help they could
get down there that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had not been ordered down there?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do with your car?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. I parked it on the north end of the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. I approached Putnam. They were dispersing some traffic
officers or some officers who worked traffic. They weren't in the traffic division,
they were patrol officers, and asked him at this time if there was anything
I could do, and he said, that if I would wait a few minutes I could probably
go hop in Sergeant Dean's station wagon. I&mdash;he didn't elaborate, and I stayed
there in the basement there for a few minutes. I don't know exactly how long
and Lieutenant Pierce came down and Sergeant Putnam spoke to me, and said,
"Why don't you go with us?" And I approached Lieutenant Pierce's car and
he was in this&mdash;he was in his car at this time and asked him if he wanted
me to go with him and he said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were in uniform, I take it?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, what happened?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. So, I got into the back seat of Lieutenant Pierce's car.
We started to drive out and Sergeant Putnam had to move some reporters back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many were there?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. I would say in the vicinity of 35. That is a guess, of course,
I have no way of knowing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. At the&mdash;that was at the bottom of both ramps, down right
outside the jail door, and part of the people were blocking the Main Street
ramp where we were going to make a turn and go out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, he cleared them out and the car followed behind him?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what time it was, about, when he left?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Well, now, at that time, I wasn't noticing the time, but since
all this <span class="locked">happened&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I don't want you to state what knowledge you have gained
since, because we can get at that other ways.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Well, at that time I thought I had been in the basement
approximately 10 or 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you got there at 11 o'clock?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Somewhere in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you would think that it would be around 11:15 or 11:16?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Somewhere thereabouts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, where were you seated in the car?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. On the left side in the back seat. That is the left side
facing the way the automobile faces.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you observe when you got to the top of the ramp?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. The best I can remember when we pulled to the top of the
ramp and paused, I was looking across Main Street. There was a group of
people, a bus or something that attracted my attention&mdash;whatever it was I&mdash;it
didn't amount to much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that to your left, or to your right?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. That <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Straight ahead?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Almost straight ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, when you got to the top of the ramp, did the car stop?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. I believe there was a momentary hesitation. I don't recall
how long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Officer Vaughn?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. I didn't pay any attention to him on the way out. Now, on
the way in, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say when you were coming at 11 o'clock, you saw him?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Yes, sir. I didn't pay any attention to him on the way out,
as I say, I was looking across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't recall having seen him at all?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you look to your right down Main Street in the direction
of Pearl?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. I don't believe so. I don't remember if I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you look to your left down Main Street in the direction
of Harwood?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, your position is you didn't look either way?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. I don't believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, you didn't see anybody on either side?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you got around to the Commerce Street side had
the shooting already taken place?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Yes, sir; I suppose it had, because as we&mdash;correction&mdash;as
the Lieutenant backed our car into position in front of the armored car, I
heard the dispatcher call an ambulance code 3, to the basement and officers
were rushing around, covering exits to the city hall, so apparently it happened
just before we arrived. That had given them time to call the dispatcher
by phone for an ambulance, would be my guess that we were on Harwood
Street at the time that it happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any further connection with the event?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. We went to Parkland. Lieutenant Pierce, Sergeant Putnam,
and I went to Parkland Hospital and set up security out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk with Jack Ruby at anytime?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the man?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. I know him slightly. I know him by sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him in the ramp at anytime while you were
driving up?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him at anytime that day at all, at any place?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I am marking now three documents as indicated. This is
a document, apparently a letter dated November 26, 1963, addressed to Chief
J.&nbsp;E. Curry, the original of which is signed by you, and two pages. I am
marking the first page, "Dallas, Texas, Exhibit&mdash;March 25, 1964, Exhibit 5094,
from the deposition of B.&nbsp;J. Maxey," and signing my name below that on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
the first page, and I am putting my initials on the lower right-hand corner of
the second page and I'll ask you to be reading that while I mark the second
document, which is a report of an FBI interview of December 6, 1963, taken
of you by FBI Agents Quigley and Dallman and I am marking that document,
"Dallas, Texas, March 25, 1964, Exhibit No. 5095. Deposition of B.&nbsp;J.
Maxey." I am signing my name, Leon D. Hubert underneath, and marking
the second page of that document by my initial in the lower right-hand corner.
The third document, I am marking in the margin, right-hand margin, "Dallas,
Texas, March 25, 1964. Exhibit 5096. Deposition of B.&nbsp;J. Maxey," and signing
my name Leon D. Hubert, Jr. I am marking the second page of that document
with my initials in the lower right-hand corner, and the third page with
my initials in the lower right-hand corner. I will ask you to read these two
documents likewise, and I wish to ask you some questions about them.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. As far as the report here written to the chief, I would
say that it is accurate at the time that I wrote it, and I am willing to sign it
as is, and I&mdash;what page was it you wanted me to sign here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just under my name.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Initial the second page.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now, you can turn to the next exhibit, which <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. The FBI report. There are two of them there. I believe
both of them are the same, aren't they? Wait a minute. One of them
might possibly be a supplement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; they are different. One is on the 2d of December and the
other is on the 6th, so, you'd better separate them. Do you have any comments
to make on them?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. One of the things that I was going to bring up here,
changes has been made in this one already, this second one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let's see, we are talking about Exhibit 5095.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What comment do you wish to make?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. In the first report it was stated in there that the FBI report
of December 3, I <span class="locked">believe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 2d.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. 2d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. And the report of December 2, Exhibit 5096, it was stated
that I saw ex-police officer Daniels and shoeshine boy at the end of the Main
Street ramp. That was incorrect. I did not. That was hearsay. I heard
that from other officers. I did not see them myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And, as a result of that error you then called the FBI and told
them you wished to correct that, is that correct?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No, sir; they came back out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They came back out and said what?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. And asked me some more questions regarding the shine boy.
They ask me then did I recall the time and I know at the time I talked to them
the first time I told them several things that I didn't see myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. I told them things that I had heard and what have you, and
I tried to differentiate between what I could actually testify and what I couldn't
at this time he was talking to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your present recollection is what then? Which is correct?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. My present recollection is that I didn't see Daniels. I
didn't see the shine boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that the information that you did give about seeing Daniels
and the shine boy in the earlier deposition&mdash;I mean the earlier statement to the
FBI, which is contained in Exhibit 5096 was erroneous in that you had not really
seen them, but you had heard people talk about them?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in all three statements, however, 5094 and 5095, and 5096,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
you stated then that you did see Officer Vaughn and yet, as I recall your testimony
this evening you said that you did not recall having seen Vaughn.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. At the present time I don't, but those were written up close
to the time all this happened, and I haven't seen one of those reports since, and
lots that I don't remember right now that I remembered then, I am sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's correct, and that's why I wanted you to correct this
apparently contradictory statement.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. That's true, I understand that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because, we don't want to have the record, if we can, to have
conflicts in it.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Neither do I, I can assure you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, your statement is that you can't swear tonight that you saw
Vaughn there?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No; I can recollect at the time, how&mdash;at the time I was questioned
about Vaughn, the main thing they wanted to know about him at that time
was how far he had walked from his position to the curb. Whether he walked
to the curb or out into the street which I didn't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And right now your mind is blank on Vaughn altogether, I take it?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Actually, yes. I wasn't&mdash;right now I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, has anybody asked you to change your statement?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No, uh-huh, so far as that goes, I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you spoken to anybody about it?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. As far as that goes I haven't talked to anybody about the
statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have talked to anybody about the possible conflict in your
statement?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Uh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don't know how that comes out on the machine. I suppose you
mean "no" by that.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No; no. I'd like to say this: That as far as the conflicting
statements are concerned, the only reason a person would have for getting
together and getting his story straight would be to have something to hide,
and I want it known right now I have nothing to hide, and I want it on the
record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, sir; it is on the record. This is not an effort to cross you
up in any way.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. I realize that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you realize that these statements do exist, and the purpose
of this deposition, among other things, is to determine the real facts, and when
you run into a conflict like this, unless we ask for explanations we do not get a
clear picture.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. That's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. I want to ask you again if you have any explanation,
any other explanation to offer now as to conflicts, or is it just simply your opinion
that insofar as Vaughn is concerned, your memory was better then than it is
now about that event?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Yes; I hadn't thought about it too much one way or the
other since then. I will say excluding 4 or 5 days thereafter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And as to Daniels and the colored boy, your statement now
is that that was hearsay. You did not, <span class="locked">yourself&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. That was hearsay, and I gave it to him as an&mdash;as a hearsay
statement. That was a matter of semantics in my opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that the record can show we are all talking about the same
documents, I would like you to sign below my signature and initial the pages
of 5096 and 5095, with the understanding that this is not an approval by you
of these statements at all, but simply as a means of identification that you
and I were both talking about the same document. So, I would like you to
sign my&mdash;just below mine and put your initials on the preceding pages.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Where is your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. My name is right down here in the margin. Just put it right
in there. Then initial the other pages until you get to the second FBI statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
and then sign under my name. In other words, where my name is signed,
sign your name. Where my initials are, put your initials.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Well, now, there is some more points that I want to bring
up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let's do this anyhow, what we are doing.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I say, this is solely for the purposes of the record showing
that we are talking about the same pieces of paper.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have further corrections or comments you wish to
make on these documents?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Yes, sir; perhaps they are of no importance, and perhaps
they are, but it is apparently a misunderstanding on the part&mdash;matter of
semantics, again, and let's see&mdash;paragraph 5, on page 1, states here that&mdash;"A
few minutes after that Lieutenant Pierce entered the garage driving a
black car." Now, I don't remember him entering the garage. I believe his
car was already parked down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is that?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Lieutenant Pierce. I don't believe he drove into the police
garage from outside. I believe his car was already parked in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. And other comments?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Page 2, paragraph 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is still 5095?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Yes, sir; page 2, paragraph 8. That was the correction
I advised the FBI office that I did not actually see Daniels and the shoeshine
boy. That this was something I had overheard other officers talking about,
and that has already been taken care of. Page 3, paragraph 10. This is
<span class="locked">concerning&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the 10th paragraph of&mdash;actually, the third paragraph,
I guess, on that page.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Well, it is part of a paragraph and a full paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Last paragraph on the <span class="locked">third&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No, sir; next to the last.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, second to the last?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Next to the last on the second page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. It's concerning Jack Ruby. "He first met <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that in quotes? You are reading that, aren't you?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Uh-huh. It states here that I first met him about 2 years
ago there that&mdash;at his place of business, that I had my wife with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With you?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. The correction would be that my wife was not with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your wife was not with you?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Not at the time I first met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that the record can be clear on a point, did you ever go
there with your wife at some other time?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Not the Carousel Club. The Vegas Club; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. And, let's see. I guess that's about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, that is to 5095. Have you any comments as to
5096? I think that is the one that contains your explanation on the previous
point.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No; second one is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. Wait a minute. I didn't read this. That's all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have anything more you want to say? Anything you
want to add?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No, sir; that's it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. About all of it, those two statements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don't believe that there has been any previous interview between
you and me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or any member of the Commission's staff?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Maxey</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir; thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is your own private business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No, sir; I am with Sears Roebuck &amp; Company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see, and are you in charge of a division or something with that
company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state what it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. In charge of accounting and the auditing and the accounts payable
of the mail order catalog business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the <span class="locked">Dallas&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Dallas region.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Thirty-five years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are also, as I understand, a member of the reserve on
the Dallas Police Force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been with the reserve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Six years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you have occasion to be called to duty on November 24,
1963, the Sunday after the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been on duty prior to that Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I want to concern ourselves solely with the Sunday, right
now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No; not on Sunday, not until I was called at 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; at 9 o'clock, you did get a call to come on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was it from, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I think it was Sergeant Maxey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ask you to notify any other reservists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who were they, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. He asked me to call the reservists in my squad, which consists of
about six, seven people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are a lieutenant, aren't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I'm a sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you did call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I called the men, but none of them showed up. They had all
gone to church, or was fixing to go to church. I contacted a lot of them and
they were leaving to go to Sunday school and they had other plans and none
of them could make it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Holly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get in touch with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I got in touch with him and he said he would come down as
soon as he got loose. I didn't see him at the city hall, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you speak to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I called him on the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell him what time he should get down there or what
time the transfer was going to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I told him he should try to be there between 10 and 10:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell him what time the transfer was going to be, or
that you thought it was going to be, or anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I told him it might be sometime between 10 and noon. I didn't
know for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't see him any more after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I didn't see him down at the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you get to the city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I got there about 9:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you stationed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I was stationed right here, at Commerce Street, guarding this
entrance to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that the witness is pointing to the mockup,
and he points to the sidewalk area in front of the Commerce Street <span class="locked">exit&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of the police department. How long did you stay there, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I was there from about 10:15 until about 11:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were <span class="locked">what&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Then, I left and <span class="locked">went&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were your duties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. My duty was to guard the entrance to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say "guard," what do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I was not to permit any people to go in there except maybe the
press that had a certified press card.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you given any description of the kind of cards that you
could honor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I was told that they probably would have a press card with their
picture on it and their newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have occasion to refuse entrance to anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir; several people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You turned them away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did some pass by you, that is to say, with your consent, after
being properly identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. You mean enter the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I let two in from newspapers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And they were properly identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. They were properly identified. One of them had a two-wheeled
cart, similar to a two-wheel golf cart and pulling some equipment on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of equipment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. It looked like cameras and typewriters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Jack Ruby or have you seen any pictures since
in the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir; I don't know him, but I have seen his picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you be willing to state that neither of those two men
that you let in was Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Neither of those two men were him. They were smaller in
stature. I want to tell you that at 11:30, I left the entrance and went to
the other one on Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that the witness is pointing to the mockup
and when he says he left "this entrance," he was pointing to the Commerce
Street entrance, and then he went to <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Main Street entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Main Street entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. The <span class="locked">other&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I went in the building, stayed over there until 1:10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I got off duty and went home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't go out to the Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No, sir; I was asked to go, but didn't have any relief so they wanted
the guard, there was about a hundred or so people congregating and coming
up from church and everywhere else, and just a big crowd there, see, and I
was needed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the Main Street entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, for purposes of identification I want to mark
what purports to be a signed copy of a report to Chief Curry, dated December 3,
1963, and signed, actually, by Jack Revill, and F.&nbsp;I. Cornwall, by placing in
the right-hand margin the following, "Dallas, Tex., March 26, 1964, Exhibit
No. 5111, deposition of R.&nbsp;L. Mayo." I am signing my name under that, and
I'll ask you if you have read that, Mr. Mayo? I mean read the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, I have read that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you endorse your name underneath it? I'm also endorsing
a document which is a report of FBI Agent Wilkinson dated December 5,
1963, by placing on the right-hand margin the following: "Dallas, Tex., March
26, 1964, Exhibit No. 5112, deposition of H.&nbsp;L. Mayo." I'm signing my name
and ask you to sign your name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. What is this right here [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like you to read it first. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Do you want me to sign this? I talked to Mr. <span class="locked">Wilkinson&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes. As far as you know, then, the contents of the documents
marked 5111 and 5112, are correct reports of interviews to which they relate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that I am not taking out of the bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
volume, Commission Document 81-A, page 70, the signed statement by Mr. Mayo.
Mr. Mayo, do you have anything more to add? Anything new that has not
been brought up in either this deposition or these two Exhibits, 5111 and 5112?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Well, could you cut this off a minute and let's talk about it and
see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that Mr. Mayo wanted to acquaint me with
the general nature of another matter, but that after he had spoken a few
sentences, it became apparent to me that it should be a matter of record, so, I
will ask you now, Mr. Mayo, just simply to repeat what you have said to me
in the last few sentences off the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. The first individual that tried to gain entrance into the basement
said that he was a minister and he had a small book in his hand and I asked
him what his business was. He said he wanted to go see Lee Harvey Oswald,
that he was a friend of his, a minister that was supposed to help him, and he
needed him, and he needed to go down there, and I told him "No, he could not
enter without"&mdash;now, that is when I was on the Commerce Street side, and he
hung around the entrance for some 20 minutes, I think, and he kept looking
in the basement and acted very peculiar, but finally he left within about 20
minutes. He was tall, skinny, looked like over 6 feet tall, and looked like he was
a man between 55 and 60.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was he dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. He had on a suit. I don't recall the color of it, but it was just
a suit, business suit with a necktie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have a hat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir; he had a hat on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And a coat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A top coat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I don't believe that he had <span class="locked">on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Regular coat, suit coat, not an overcoat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you say you reported the fact to <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I mentioned that to Jack Revill, and they said, well, it was probably
just like lots of people trying to gain entrance. They didn't think it had
much value.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he suggested that it be left out of your report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. When I changed positions&mdash;stations, and went from Commerce
Street to the Main Street side, about 10 minutes after Oswald had been placed
in the ambulance, I cleared the way for them to get out of the entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I went to the other side, and a large gentleman, well, he was
slightly bald, weighed over 200 pounds, and walked with a limp. He came up
to me and then said that he was a roommate of Jack Ruby, and that he wanted
to go down and talk to him. And I told him he could not enter. I asked him
what was the nature of his business and he said that Mr. Ruby had quite a
sum of money on his person and he wanted to go down there and see if he
wanted him to handle it for him. I told him he couldn't go down and he stayed
up around there about 20 or 30 minutes, and finally went on down Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give you his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I didn't ask him his name. He didn't give me his name. I told
him he couldn't enter&mdash;and he walked with a limp. I remember that. He was
a large fellow. Had no tie on and slightly bald. No hat on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he claimed to be a roommate of Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Jack Ruby; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you describe him otherwise, his hair, his <span class="locked">height&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I'd say he was over 6 feet tall, and much heavier than I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have given all that information, I think. Did he have a
coat on?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No, sir; he had no coat on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just a shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Just a shirt, heavy shirt and no tie on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you gave that information to Jack Revill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I mentioned it to him and he said, well, just probably somebody
knew him and trying to use an excuse to get in, so, he didn't feel like it was&mdash;it
is my opinion it might be this fellow Senator that we have been hearing
about. I don't know how you spell his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you estimate what time it was that this man, the heavy
man, tried to get in to see Jack Ruby through the Main Street entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Sir, I would only have to estimate it at, I would say, around
11:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, anything else that you mentioned to Revill that was not
put down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir. I mentioned about the tourists. That is a man and
a woman that hung around the entrance on the Main Street side and said
they were just passing through Dallas, and they lived in Springfield, Ill.,
I believe they said, and they wanted to take some pictures, and they kept
hanging around the entrance and they did take a few pictures and finally
left. I don't know if they are connected with it or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anyhow, you mentioned that episode to Jack Revill and he also
was of the opinion that it was not important?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Minor, minor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any other things then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir. While I was on the Commerce Street side I had a
Ford Fairlane car that came up about three times with two men in the front
seat, and each time they would stop and ask me if he had come down&mdash;"What's
happening?" I wondered then&mdash;now, I didn't mention that to Revill,
because I didn't think about it at the time, but I wondered since then if they
had some connection with <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not mention that to Revill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you didn't take the license number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No, sir; it was just routine to me. They kept coming by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how many times did they pass you, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Third <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw them three times? Three times they came down
Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Came down&mdash;Commerce is one way going east, and they came
down on my side and they slowed down and stopped and asked me, "Has he
come down? Is anything happening?" And I would motion them on, because
my job was to keep the street open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that happened three times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And after the third time, what happened? Is that when the
shot was fired or something, or you didn't see them any more <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. After&mdash;I didn't hear the shot, but the hustle and bustle and
noise in the basement, I looked down there and the men and all going around
and around. Everything&mdash;and I heard a little radio from a pedestrian that
said that Oswald had been shot, broadcast, and just about that time, I saw
them going down Commerce Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say "them," you mean the two men in the Fairlane
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir. They were just a little past the entrance when all this
commotion started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the third trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. That was the third trip down. I went on down&mdash;went downstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't notice whether it was a Texas license or not;
or out of State?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I didn't get a chance to see the license.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ford Fairlane. Do you remember the color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Seemed to me like it was a blue, or light color of some kind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a sedan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. It was a 4-door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 4-door sedan? Hard top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir; hard top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What model, about? A new car? Could you give us some
idea about the model?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. It was a late model car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a 1964 model?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No, no; it wasn't a 1964 model. If I was going to guess I would
say a 1962 or 1963&mdash;one. That man was hatless and he had a high forehead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He wasn't bald was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I wouldn't say he was bald, just had a high forehead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that the driver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. That was the driver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was he dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. He had on an old, old&mdash;looks like he had a heavy wool shirt like
you wear in the winter, long sleeves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have a tie on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No tie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What color was the shirt? Do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. The shirt&mdash;it was kind of checked color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he dark complected?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. He was dark complected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old a man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I would guess in the forties, just by looking at him, and I have
wondered since about his interest in it. Maybe just somebody that was inquisitive
and wanted to see what was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could be. On the other hand we want to get all the facts, and
that is a fact. What about the other man? Did you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I didn't pay much attention to him, because he was on the other
side and I was dealing with the driver. It was a one-way street, and I was
dealing with the driver over here and I didn't pay too much attention to the
other man. I couldn't even describe him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How close do you suppose you were to this man each time he
drove up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Oh, I'd say 4 to 6 feet. See, my duty was to stand on the sidewalk
and keep the overflow of people&mdash;we had about 200 people, and if I
moved out, somebody on the sidewalk could go in behind me, and I didn't get
too far from the entrance of <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I'm going to show you a set of pictures and ask if that man
there&mdash;look at them all first before you answer&mdash;bears any resemblance at all
to the man you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that the witness was looking at the pictures
of Curtis Lavern Crafard. What about the other man in the car? Did he
look like this fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Sir, I wasn't close enough to make any identification or recognize
him. He was on the other side and I wasn't able to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, was there anything else that you want to state to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No; I can't think of anything else, sir. It was all just&mdash;I'd say,
a state of commotion and confusion when this happened, and I had people
everywhere around me and I just assumed that they are curiosity seekers.
Making various comments about the assassination of a President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I want to identify these pictures a little further. The pictures
that were shown to the witness were various views of a man by the name of Curtis
Lavern Crafard, taken November 28, 1963, by the FBI, and forwarded to the
Commission recently. All right, sir. Is there anything else that you want
to state about anything we have been talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No; I can't think of anything else that would pertain to this in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
any way and my work there. I was just on duty that morning and doing the
best I could, and I can't think of any other incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Well, let me ask you this: Have you ever been interviewed
by me or any other member of the Commission at any time except, of
course, with this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No, sir; I've not been interviewed by you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About a moment ago we went off the record. Have we covered,
since we have been back on the record everything that you told me while we
were off the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. That is it. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. I want to express my appreciation to you people. I think you
have done a fine job about investigating this thing, and I'm very happy to
cooperate with you. I hope that you are able to solve this thing out and get
it straight out, because I still think in my mind there was something back of
this, because too much confusion around these entrances, and I, personally
want to express my appreciation to every one of you people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean by "too much confusion"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Seemed to me like people standing around and looking around.
I don't know. People are funny. I have been working a long time. They
just move around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean a lot of members of the public?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Public; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, let me clarify one thing, did your remark intend to say
that the security methods weren't sufficient?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No, sir; I think the security methods were very fine, but I just
wondered why the curiosity. I still wonder in my own mind. I don't know.
I wonder why so many people were down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; well, I wanted to get that straight, because at first I thought
your remark might be construed by someone as being critical of the security
measures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. No, sir; the security measures was, at this time, was very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, sir; that's all.</p>

<h2 id="LDM">TESTIMONY OF LOUIS D. MILLER</h2>

<p>The testimony of Louis D. Miller was taken at 3:55 p.m., on March 24, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will swear you in, Mr. Miller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Before we do that, what are we doing here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We are taking your deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I'd like to understand what we are doing here first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, all right. I'll be happy to explain it to you. First of
all so that we can get the record straight, my name is Burt Griffin, and I am a
member of the advisory staff of the general counsel of the President's Commission
to investigate the assassination of President Kennedy. And the Commission
has been appointed under Executive Order 11130, issued November 29, 1963, by
President Johnson, under joint resolution of Congress No. 137, to investigate the
facts surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent
violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald, and the other circumstances that were
attendant on these two offenses. Now, I have been authorized, under the rules
of the Commission, to take your sworn deposition, and Chief Curry has a copy
of that authorization. I will be happy to show it to you if you care to see it.
Our particular interest in your testimony is to determine what facts you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
about the death of Lee Harvey Oswald, but also to determine any other pertinent
facts that you may know about the general inquiry which the Commission is
authorized to go into. Now, you are here today because we have made a request
from the General Counsel on the Commission staff, and pursuant to the rules
adopted by the Commission, and we have made the request to Chief Curry.
Now, you are entitled to a 3-day written notice prior to having this deposition
taken, and if you would like that we would be happy to do that. We had presumed
that probably the police officers would prefer to have the notice waived.
You are also entitled to have an attorney present during this interrogation.
Now, I have no objection in any way you want to handle this. I want you to be
perfectly frank in telling us, because we have gone ahead, as I said, simply on
the assumption that you probably would prefer to waive these matters, but if
you would like to have the written notice and would like to have a copy of the
authorizing resolution, or would like to have an attorney present during this
deposition we would be <span class="locked">happy&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; I just want to understand what is going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, do you have any question that you want to ask me about
it? I have given you a general statement here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. What will this deposition be used for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, this deposition will be made a part of the Commission's
files. It will not be turned over to any member of the police department. These
files will remain in the possession of the Commission, and on the basis of all
of the investigation which we are conducting here, why, there will be a report
written. Now, I can't tell you what is going to happen to the files after&mdash;and
that means this deposition&mdash;after the Commission issues its report. I would
like to be able to give you the assurance that it will be impossible for anybody
to ever see this deposition. I can't, in honesty, tell you that, because I don't
know that that is true. On the other hand, I don't know that it is not true,
but basically, it will be used to write a report, and your testimony that you
would give would be one of probably close to 250, maybe 500 depositions that
are going to be taken during this period. I think 500 might be a pretty fair
estimate, together with thousands, and probably approaching ten thousand
pages of investigative reports and other documents also in addition to all these
investigative reports. That is where it is all going to wind up. But, I can assure
you of this: That no copies of this are going to be turned over to any member
of the police department or any official of the State of Texas as such. Now,
whether or not the thing will be accessible because they are all deposited in
the archives, and years from now somebody could go and look at them, I don't
know the answers to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, is what you want from me a statement of what happened
down there? Is that what you are getting at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; but let me tell you this, too, that if you feel that you
would prefer to talk about this thing off the record and that you think you
would have important information to give us that you prefer to be kept&mdash;to
have some assurances that your confidences would be kept completely, I would
be happy to defer this deposition and do it in such a way that no one would
know the reason for it, and I would check with our people in Washington to
see if there weren't some arrangements which could be made for it, because we
are most concerned with getting the truth, and as much information&mdash;I wasn't
suggesting that you wouldn't tell the truth, that we all know, and I would appreciate
if there were better circumstances under which we could do this. I
would inquire into it and I would make this a matter of complete confidence
between us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, there is nothing that I know that possibly a hundred other
people don't know, so, that part don't bother me, but I don't understand coming
down and giving a statement, that I am supposed to stand, and swearing, and
all that part of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, this is just as&mdash;I am sure you have testified before grand
juries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I sure have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of course, you have been sworn when you testified there. Only
they don't have a court reporter in the grand jury. I don't know about Texas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
but in Ohio we don't have a court reporter present. I do have the feeling in
talking to you that maybe you would like to do this under some other circumstances,
and I would be happy to explore this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I understand that you want a statement from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, I am going to examine you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. And I'll be more than glad to tell anything I know about it,
but I don't understand swearing in. This is not a court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Not a court in the sense that anybody is on trial, but it is a&mdash;let
me explain this to you, that we have authority to administer the oath, and
we have authority to punish for all consequences in violation of the oath. The
contempt provision of the Federal Code applies to this proceeding. We also
have authority&mdash;I don't have this authority personally, but there is a provision
granted that we can grant immunity from prosecution. If you feel that there
will be some evidence that you wouldn't want to give for one reason or another,
we have authority to grant immunity from prosecution. I don't have that
authority here, but&mdash;and I do want to make it clear that you can have a right
to have an attorney present, and many of the witnesses do have attorneys.
Now, on the other extreme, if you would like to have a public hearing, we will
open the hearing up to the public, but we haven't done it as a matter of routine
except upon request, because we thought that most people prefer not to have
it conducted in public, but that has been done, and we can do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I still don't understand the reason of it. Are you going to use
this thing to try to prosecute me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. What are you going to use it for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We have no authority to prosecute anyone except for perjury
before the Commission. Now, we&mdash;our instructions are&mdash;let me get a copy of
the resolutions. Let me suggest that we handle it this way. I have got a copy
here of the resolutions, Executive order signed by President Johnson, and the
joint resolutions of Congress. The rules of the Commission and a memorandum
dated March 20, 1964, from Mr. Rankin, who is the General Counsel of the
Commission authorizing Mr. Hubert and me to administer your oath and take
your deposition. Now, I think that what I prefer to do here so that you can be
sure what you want to do, and I don't want to put you under any pressure.
Now, I would like to give you this and have you try to find another room out
here and look at this, and read it over, and think about this and ponder it
as long as you want, and I want to give you assurance that I am going to call
another&mdash;I am going to call Officer Montgomery in here and proceed with him.
I am not going to tell him that I have not completed your deposition or anything
like that. I want to be sure that as far as anybody is concerned whatsoever,
what has transpired here is completely routine so that any decision you make,
I can give you as much assurance as <span class="locked">possible&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. All I wanted to know is the purpose of the thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. And if I find out we can go on with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why don't you go ahead and read this and let me go ahead with
Montgomery, and if you want I will tell Montgomery that you went on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, now, do you want me to come back some more, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; I'd <span class="locked">like&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. What time is it now? It is 4:15. I am due at home at 4:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don't want you to take that away, and I think that maybe
it would be better if you waited around. Could you call your wife and meet me
back here at 5 o'clock, and why don't you wait for me in my office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, now, could we get on with the thing? I am trying to
explain to you, I have got small kids be coming home from school <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Uh-huh. Well, would you rather think about it and come back
<span class="locked">some&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, if we can't take care of it today, I would like to come back
tomorrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, I can go ahead, you know. I want to make sure that you
are satisfied in your own mind about everything before we start to ask any
questions, and if you have any reservations or questions that I haven't answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
I want you to look at those materials, and I would be happy to set it up for
tomorrow if you would prefer to do it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I sure would.</p>

<p>Mt. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Would you&mdash;let's see, you would want to take that
home with you, wouldn't you? Let me do this. Let's go back to our office and
let me get the girl to Xerox off another copy of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And let us set this up for 8:30. What time are you on duty
tomorrow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the easiest way for you to handle it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. You mean time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Probably 9 o'clock would be the easiest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Why don't you come in at 9 o'clock then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. That's all.</p>

<h2 id="LDMR">TESTIMONY OF LOUIS D. MILLER RESUMED</h2>

<p>The testimony of Louis D. Miller was taken at 9 a.m., on March 25, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I might state for the record and for your information, Mr. Ward,
Mr. Miller, and I talked on the record a short while yesterday afternoon, and
I don't believe that, when I was talking with him, that his name was entered
into the record, so I think what you will have to do is get in touch with the
court reporter&mdash;is it Iris Lennon or Leonard?&mdash;and find out from her just
where that is so that these two different sections can appear together.</p>

<p>Before I ask you to be sworn, Mr. Miller, I want to ask you if there are any
questions that I can&mdash;that you have of me, I can tell you anything further
about the nature of the investigation that is going on here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; and had you explained to me yesterday what kind of information
you were taking, what it would be used for, anything at all about it
before you started to swear me in, I believe we would have got a lot further
yesterday than we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you want to raise your right hand and be sworn?
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Louis D. Miller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how do you spell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. [Spelling] L-o-u-i-s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live, Mr. Miller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. 1231 Ravina Drive, Garland, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. September 4, 1930.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. City of Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how long have you been with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Since August 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what is your rank in the department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Detective.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you assigned to any particular bureau?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Juvenile bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been in the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Since October of last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And where were you before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Radio patrol division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Whose platoon did you work on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The last platoon that I worked on was Captain Souter's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I understand that you were off duty on Friday, November
22, is that right, of last year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The best that I remember, yes, I was off the day the President
was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how about the next day, Saturday, November the 23d, were
you on duty or off duty that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. On Saturday, I should have worked. I don't remember specifically
any particular incident that happened that day that would bring to my mind
that I did work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, is there any reason for you to think that you didn't work
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any records of any sort back at the police department
or notes that you have maintained which would indicate whether or not
you worked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. There should be some, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What sort of records would those be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Offenses that was assigned to me, prisoners handled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wonder if you could, when you return to the police department,
if you could check to see if those records are available and provide copies of
them to us, or if you can't make the copies, why if you will provide us with the
originals, why we will make the copy and return the originals to you. Would
you be willing to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. If I could. I would have to look through things that I have in
my locker, a place there, and see if I have any there that were assigned to me on
that date, otherwise it would be next to impossible, and see what prisoners I
did handle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you supposed to make a report at the end of the day as to
your activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, I don't want you&mdash;I am not asking you to go through that
and see what prisoners you handled if you can't find it readily, but it would
be easy to find some record of whether you were on duty at all, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It would be marked in the duty book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. If you would, check that and let us know, and if you
do have any notes that pertain to those days, I would appreciate that, also.
All right. Now, do you have any recollection of when you first heard in any
way that Lee Harvey Oswald might be moved to the Dallas County Jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; I don't remember when I heard it or how I heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall coming to work Sunday morning on the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I remember being at work. As to the time that I came to work,
no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what time you usually report to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I usually get in the office sometime between 7 and 7:30 and some
days earlier than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any reason to think you arrived any later than
<span class="locked">7:30&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I couldn't be definite on it because I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you ride to work when you come, take public transportation,
or do you drive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you drive in alone or with somebody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I drive in alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, on Sunday, do you recall whether you drove in alone or
with somebody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't recall driving in at all that day, as far as that goes, but
I am sure that I did, and I am sure I drove alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what you did in the early morning when you got
to work on that Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Nothing definite, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, did you report up to the third floor to the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what you did when you got to the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No, sir; nothing definite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it that you have some indefinite ideas of what happened
up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, I can tell you what I usually do when I come up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, was this a usual day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. As far as I was concerned, in my business, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember the people who were on duty up there on
Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Let's see. Detective Goolsby, Detective Cutchshaw, [spelling]
C-u-t&mdash;I believe he spells his name [spelling] C-u-t-c-h-a-w. I am not sure
about that spelling. Detective Lowery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Cutchshaw, Lowery, Officer J.&nbsp;W. Harrison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that "Blackie" Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes; and Policewoman McLine [spelling] M-c-L-i-n-e.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is Policewoman McLine attached to the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The people that you have listed, is that the full staff of people
who are on duty regularly at that time or are there other people also ordinarily
who would be on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; who is on duty would depend on the days off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember if there were any other people, whose names
you might not recall, who were also on duty in the juvenile bureau that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Captain Martin that day, the best that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Did you see him up in the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anybody else that you can think of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; that I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got up to the juvenile bureau that morning, did
you talk to any of these people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I am sure I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you talk to up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I probably talked to everybody that was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. When you arrived, were there television cameras
on the third floor hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The best that I remember, there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether or not those TV cameras were manned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't remember definitely whether they were or not, but I don't
believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Can you give us some sort of idea of how crowded
the hallways, that hallway was, when you arrived for work in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It wasn't crowded at all when I arrived at work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, had you been there before when it was more crowded than
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Directing your attention to Saturday, can you give us a description
of what the status of that hallway was on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't remember any definite time or whether it was Saturday,
but I had been in the hallway when it was almost impassable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you in the police department on Friday at all?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I understand at the time that you remember this hallway being
impassable was sometime before you arrived for work on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That would have had to have been Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It probably was on Saturday, but I don't remember. I can't
remember that it was definitely Saturday or any certain time on Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you think it would have been on Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; it wasn't on Friday, because I didn't go near the police station
on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, while you were in the homicide or in the juvenile bureau
on Sunday, did any newspaper people or radio or TV people come into the
juvenile bureau for any purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't remember any specific ones coming in, but they were in
and out, so I am sure they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what was their purpose in coming in and out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. They usually come in to use the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were you people able to conduct your activities in the
juvenile bureau with these newspaper people coming in and out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. They didn't interfere with my business. As far as the other
people assigned to the bureau, I don't know whether they interfered with them
or not. I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of business were you transacting in the morning,
Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Just routine work is all I recall. If you would give me something
definite to go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, were you investigating any particular cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. At what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Prior to the time that you went down to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Prior to that time, an officer had brought in two small children,
as I recall. I don't now remember what they were brought in for, but I was
working them, doing the paper work on them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How soon was that after you got up to the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. That was later on in the morning, the best I remember, and
I was working on the paperwork on them when I was told to report to the
basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Prior to bringing in those two children, did you talk with anybody
in the juvenile bureau about the prospective move of Lee Harvey Oswald
to the Dallas County Jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I could have. I don't recall it, though. In fact, I didn't even
know that&mdash;for sure that Oswald was still in our jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, you heard the newspaper reporters come in and out
of the office, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't remember any specific incident of when they came in
and out. Like I said, they probably did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear them talk on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I didn't pay any attention to what they were saying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you close enough to them to hear what they were
saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I didn't try to hear them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you close enough to hear them if you had tried to hear
them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't recall it if I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Whereabouts in the juvenile bureau did you work that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. We have several desks up there, and it is possible that I worked
at all of them some time during the day. I don't remember any particular
desk or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is the juvenile bureau, is it one large room or does it
have a series of rooms in it or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It has several rooms, I would say. It has a reception office
affair in front, and the captain's office is off of that, and then a short hallway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
and the lieutenant's office, there is a holdover room for children, and then the
main office, and then off of the main office we have two interrogation rooms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you have a desk in any one of those offices assigned to
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were the newspaper reporters, did they come into the main
office on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't recall any specific incident where they came in, but I
feel sure that they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you work at any time out in the front office or the
reception area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't recall whether I did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did there come a time when you were requested to go down into
the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what is your best estimate of when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I wouldn't have any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before you got this request, had you been down in the basement
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It is possible that I had, but I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you were asked to prepare a report of your activities on
the 24th, isn't that right, the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I was asked to write a letter and put in the information of what
position I was in down in the basement at the time Oswald was shot and
things of that nature, not everything that I did that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When were you requested to make this report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't remember what day it was. I don't believe it was on
that Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what you were told to do when you were
asked to make out the report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who instructed you to make out the report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't recall who that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, was it just a general announcement that was made by one
of the chiefs or did somebody in particular approach you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It was probably someone in particular, but I don't recall who it
was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you discuss this report with anybody before you made it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It is possible that I did, but I don't recall it if I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was it on the 24th that asked you to go down into the
basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The best I recall, it was kind of a general announcement. Who
came up and requested or ordered, or however you wanted to put it, all of
the men to go to the basement, I don't know who that was. As I say, I was
working the papers, typing. I had <span class="locked">my&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you working at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I was working in the main office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And who was in the main office with you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, since we had been instructed early in the morning to
remain in the office until further notice, I would have to assume that all of the
people assigned up there for that day were present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember anybody who was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The only one that I can recall specifically is Policewoman McLine,
because after this announcement, request, order, whatever it was, was made for
us to go to the basement, I asked her if she would finish the paperwork on the
two small children for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember if Officer Lowery was still there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or Officer McMillon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Officer McMillon doesn't work out of our office, so I am sure he
wasn't there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Officer Harrison?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Officer Harrison works out of our office, and he was on duty that
day, but as far as remembering it, anyone other than Policewoman McLine in
particular, I couldn't do it, because I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, what did you do&mdash;well, this person who came into your&mdash;who
requested that you go down, did that person actually walk into the juvenile
bureau office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't know, because I didn't see him and I didn't hear him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, then, who told you? Who did you hear the request from
to go down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Policewoman McLine, I believe it was, the best I remember, said
something about all men have to go to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at that point, did you walk down to the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I walked down the hall and caught the elevator to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go down with anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The best I recall, the elevator was full. As far as remembering
any one particular person that was on the elevator, I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you walk out of the juvenile bureau with anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I am sure I did, but I don't recall any particular person that I
walked out with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall how many people you walked out with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Officer McLine, Policewoman McLine, told you that you
were supposed to go to the basement, what did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't recall her specific words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did she tell you why you were supposed to go down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any idea of why you were to go down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; I can't say that I actually did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you walked down to the basement, did you look into the
homicide bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't recall looking in there; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got down to the basement, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The best I recall, I was standing outside of the windows there
in the hallway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, when you got off the elevator, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Walked over to this hallway where the windows and telephones
there are in the basement outside of the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you meet anybody down there when you got off of the
elevators before you got to that window, did you meet anybody down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No particular person that I recall, although there were several
people there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you receive any instructions from anybody before you went
to this particular station that you mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you know to walk over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did you happen to walk there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. There was no particular reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how long was this before Lee Harvey Oswald came down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't recall how long. It would be hard to estimate it. It
could have been 10 minutes or it could have been longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I have got another witness out here, Mr. Ward, and I think
maybe it might be well to take a break here a second. I want to talk to this
man.</p>

<p>(Discussion off of the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Miller and I have been talking here for a few minutes off
of the record about some of the events prior to his going down into the basement.</p>

<p>Now, as I understand it, Mr. Miller, shortly after you got into the office on
Sunday morning, you went some place for some coffee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I went to the Deluxe Diner on Commerce Street and had breakfast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, who did you go over there with?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Officer Harrison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what time of the morning was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't remember a definite time, but it was probably somewhere
shortly after 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did anybody else go over there with you besides Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This a place that you regularly go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; not regularly. Occasionally, we go over for a sandwich
or we phone for sandwiches and take them up to the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you normally take a coffee break right after you go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Usually after we get our assignments in the morning, we take
a coffee break and go to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you receive assignments this morning when you came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't believe the deskman finished making assignments when
we went over to coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this the regular deskman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes. Usually we have a regular deskman, except his day off,
and on his days off, everyone takes a turn rotating working at the desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Excuse me. What was the name of the deskman that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The best I remember, Detective Goolsby was on the desk that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, where was this located on Commerce Street, this diner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It is in the 2000 block, I believe it is, almost directly across
the street from the Statler Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how many blocks would that be west of the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. That would be in the first block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you went in there that morning, were you in uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No. I never wear a uniform.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know any of the people who worked at that diner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Only when I see them. Now, I know a colored boy's over there
first name. It is Jimmy, I believe, but I couldn't be definite on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he in there on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't remember just exactly who it was on duty. There is
usually three or four working over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, when you went in there, did they have counters
and&mdash;did they have a counter and tables and booths?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It is just a counter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how many people were working behind the counter that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It would be hard to say. Like I was telling you a while ago,
there was usually maybe two, maybe four. It all depends on the amount of
business they expect, I suppose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go in there often enough so that you were familiar
with any of the people waiting behind that counter although you might not
have known them by name but you would recognize them and they would
recognize you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't think so. I doubt if I have been in there over a half
dozen times at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Officer Harrison know any of the people in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I believe he did; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I know you can't&mdash;I don't expect you to be a thousand percent
accurate on this, but do you have any idea which of the people in there that
he knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No. I have been over there with Officer Harrison, and he usually
speaks to, like this one colored boy, and I believe his name is Jimmy or Tommy
or something like that. I couldn't be sure on that, but usually speak to him.
And when we call up for sandwiches, Officer Harrison has called up there once
or twice to have them make sandwiches and pick them up, and he usually asks
for this one particular boy over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who suggested going over there for coffee that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't remember whether I suggested it or whether Officer
Harrison did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, who suggested going out for coffee?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Like I say, I don't remember whether I did or whether he did.
It would be hard to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did either you or Officer Harrison ask anybody else in the
juvenile bureau to go out for coffee with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. We probably did, but I don't remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got over there, how long did you stay at the
diner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Probably around 30 minutes at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you&mdash;what did you and Officer Harrison talk about
over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Now, I couldn't say. Couldn't say we talked about any one
thing in particular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk about the investigation of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. We could have or we could have talked about Officer Harrison's
rabbit dogs or fishing or numerous things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk about the movement of Oswald to the county jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It is possible that we did, but as far as being definite on it; I
couldn't be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you talk with anybody else over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No one that I recall; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you&mdash;did either of you receive a telephone call over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who received the telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The best I remember, when the person that works there at the
diner answered the phone, he said, "Phoned for one of you," Officer Harrison
answered it and came back to the counter and said we were to come back to
the office as soon as we finished eating and were to remain there until further
notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you who made the telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No, sir; he never did, and I never did ask him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whether it was somebody from the police department
that made that call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I presumed it was, but like I say, I never did ask Officer Harrison
who it was, and that would be the only ones that would be likely to order us to
return to the office and stay there until further notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got back to the office, did you have some idea of
why you were supposed to remain back there until further notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; I couldn't say that I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Officer Harrison talk to you at all that day about Jack
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. You mean prior <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Prior to the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; I don't think so. I couldn't be definite on that, either, but
I am sure he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know prior to the time that Ruby shot Oswald that
Officer Harrison knew Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you known Officer Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I have probably seen him around the police department ever since
I have been here. As far as actually knowing the man, I didn't up until the
time I went to work up in the juvenile bureau in October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you ever, prior to the time that Ruby shot Oswald, had
you ever gone any place socially with Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No. The best I remember, when I first came to work down here,
Officer Harrison was riding a motorcycle and I worked in radio patrol, and the
only time you can probably see each other would be passing, maybe down in
the locker room, something like that, and then he did work out at the pistol
range for a while, and when I would go to the pistol range, I would see him out
there, but as far as talking to him or going any place with him, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you ever engaged in any business enterprises with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know him any way other than in the capacity as a fellow
police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. That is the only way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did anything else happen before you went down into the
basement on Sunday morning that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I can remember those 2 children that were brought in and working&mdash;I
remember working on the papers pertaining to them and I remember asking
Policewoman McLine, after we had been told to go to the basement, if
she would finish the papers for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember anything else that happened or anything else
that was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. That is prior to going to the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after Ruby shot Oswald, did you talk with Officer Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I am sure I did. In fact, after this was all over up there, I rode
out to Love Field with Officer Harrison, so I am sure I did talk to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you talk to him about what had happened there in the
basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I am sure we did; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ask him whether he saw Ruby at any time before Ruby
shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; I don't believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to him about how Ruby got down into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I am sure we discussed it; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you remember about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't remember anything definite, but I believe that more than
likely everybody up there was wondering how he got down in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, immediately after Ruby shot Oswald, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The best I remember, at the time that this happened, I was walking
or trying to walk down towards the corridor for cars to go through in behind
of the officers and Oswald when they came out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to know what you did after Ruby was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. After Ruby was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; or Oswald was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The best I remember, someone, seemed like, hit Ruby from behind
and pushed him forward. Like I said, I was trying to move that way when this
happened, so I grabbed a hold of Ruby and helped take him into the jail
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you&mdash;were you with Ruby in the jail office when there
were a lot of officers around him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Ruby put up any sort of a struggle there in the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; none that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you&mdash;did you have physical hold of Ruby in the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. When we got into the jail office; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear Ruby say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you hear him say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. As to definite words, I could give you what he said as best I remember
it, but it may not be his exact words. It could be that he put some
more words in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The best I remember, he said something about&mdash;well, first off,
somebody asked, "Who is he?" And he said, "Oh, hell! You guys know me.
I am Jack Ruby." And the best I remember, he said something about, "I hope
the son of a bitch dies," and something about, "It will save you guys a lot of
trouble," or, "It will save everybody a lot of trouble," something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember who it was that said, "Who is it?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember anything else that was said while Ruby was
there in the jail office?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; because right after that he was moved over to the jail elevator
and was being taken upstairs, and I went out in the basement, the garage
part of the basement, again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was Ruby searched in the jail office while you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. A quick search, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A pat-down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were his pockets emptied?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Not that I remember; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, were you in the jail office when Ruby was
taken upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I couldn't be definite on that, because the best I remember it,
about the time he was being taken over to the elevator or shortly after, the
ambulance came in and picked Oswald up, and I went back out into the basement
to help try to keep this crowd of reporters or photographers and what-not out of
the way so that they could get the ambulance in and Oswald loaded into it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how long did you remain out there in the basement area
assisting with the photographers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I would say maybe 45 minutes to an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were you there when Officer Dean was interviewed on
television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't remember Officer Dean being interviewed; no. After the
ambulance got out, I went up to the ramp on the Commerce Street side. There
were several people up there who claimed to be reporters and photographers
and what-not trying to get down into the basement and trying to force their
way in, and I went up to assist with that problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. During this period from the time that Ruby was taken upstairs
and all of the time you were down there in the basement, did you talk with anybody
about how Ruby got into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It is possible that I did, but I don't&mdash;like I say, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any rumors that you heard at that time
about how he got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any rumors circulated at that time as to how he
got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. There was one that I remember, that he might have been&mdash;came
in helping a crew with a television camera that came from the basement proper
there out into the garage part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear that rumor while you were down in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I believe I did, but I couldn't be definite about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Officer Harrison stay down there in the basement with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; I don't believe he did. Now, he could have, but I don't think
so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Officer McMillon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I didn't&mdash;I don't remember seeing Officer McMillon in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Officer Lowery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do after you finished down there in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, after things quieted down up there at the Commerce Street
side, I went back up to the juvenile bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do up there in the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I couldn't be definite about it. I probably worked on some reports,
but as to <span class="locked">definite&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to anybody up there about how Ruby got into the
basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I am sure I did, but as far as remembering any particular person
that I talked to or how it was discussed, I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was up there in the juvenile bureau when you got back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Policewoman McLine is the only one that I could say that was
definitely there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was Officer Harrison at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Lowery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't know where they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when was the first time that you saw Officer Harrison
after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It was later, but as to giving you a definite time on it from the
time that this happened until we came back up to the office, it would be hard to
do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you first see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Back in the office, I believe, the best I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what did you do when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't remember any particular thing that we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how long did you remain up in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, the biggest part of the day. Captain Jones, I believe it
was, came down and told me to remain in the office until further notice again,
that I was to remain there until further notice, and then&mdash;let's see&mdash;someone
else came down shortly after that and had me go down to the chief's office.
I went down there, and Captain Jones told me to go back to the juvenile bureau
and remain until he called for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were you wanted for in the chief's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No one ever said, and apparently it was a mixup in the orders
there, or something of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you actually talk with Jones when you got down there
to the chief's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Only that he told me to go back to the juvenile bureau and wait
until he notified me, that he had an assignment for me and he was going to
notify me what it was later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. How long did you remain back in the juvenile
office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I couldn't say definitely. I know later on that afternoon, I
believe it was Officer Harrison and Detectives Cutchshaw and Lowery, the best
I remember, and myself, were called down to the chief's office and given an
assignment, but what time it was, a definite time, I presume it would have been
around 4 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And who gave you the assignment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Chief Stevenson, the best I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And where were you sent to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I was sent to Love Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did the four of you all go out to Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were you to do out there at Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. We were to check around the American Airlines ticket office
and watch proceedings around there, around the ticket counter, out there around
the American Airlines ticket counter, the best I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were you looking for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, after we had left the chief's office, we started out to Love
Field, and Captain Martin called us back into the basement, and, the best
I remember, he told us that Mayor Cabell had been scheduled to go to Washington,
or some place, on an airplane, and they had had a call that there had
been a bomb placed on the plane or was going to be a bomb placed on it, or
something of that nature, and I believe it was because of this that we were
sent out to American Airlines, and my understanding is that the mayor was
supposed to have left on a Braniff plane and changed it and left on an American
Airlines plane later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were you looking for around the American Airlines office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Anyone that might have been carrying a gun or a bomb or anything
of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have a description of anyone in particular to look for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you all talk about on the way out there in the
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I am sure we talked about this shooting. Again, I couldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
be definite on it. Like I say, I am sure everybody in the department was talking
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you hear in the car about how Ruby was shot, how
Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. You mean&mdash;well. Officer Harrison and myself were in one car
and Detectives Lowery and Cutchshaw in another car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you hear&mdash;what did you hear from Harrison as to
<span class="locked">how&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Again, I couldn't be definite on any part of the conversation.
Like I say, I am sure we discussed the thing and talked about it, but as to
any definite words, I couldn't be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, there are various rumors that have circulated about
how Ruby got into the basement, and I am sure you are familiar with all
of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, <span class="locked">now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which of the rumors did you discuss in the automobile that
you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, the best I remember, the only rumor I had heard up until
that time had been the one that Ruby had come in with this camera crew.
Again, I can't be definite, but I believe it was on Monday, the following day,
that I heard this rumor, whatever it was, that he had entered <span class="locked">off&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The Main Street ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got out there&mdash;when you saw Cutchshaw and
Lowery out there at the American Airlines, did you discuss with them this
rumor about coming in with the camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I am sure we did, but again I couldn't&mdash;any definite words
that were said or anything like that, I couldn't be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember anybody in that group saying that he saw
a man come by with a camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, the best I remember, Detective Lowery, I believe it was,
said something about this camera coming by, and I vaguely remember the
camera coming by myself, but as far as a number of men and who they
were that were bringing this camera in, again I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Harrison? Did he indicate at that time that he
remembered the camera?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Not that I recall; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Cutchshaw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So Lowery was the only one that you can remember talking
about the camera, having seen this camera come by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. He is the only one that I recall, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything else you want to tell us about the events of
Sunday, November 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, I don't remember anything that I could tell. If I was
asked a question on it and knew the answer on it, I would be more than glad
to answer the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you heard any rumors concerning anyone who might have
seen Ruby down in the basement prior to the shooting of Oswald? (Pause) Is
your answer "No"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell me. Were you down in the basement when Rio Pierce's
car drove out of the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I remember a car driving out, which would be the wrong way
up towards Main Street, but as far as remembering who was driving the car,
I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you standing when that car drove out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I was standing by the door to the jail office, the door that comes
out into the garage portion of the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who stationed you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Nobody. Like I was telling you before, we were out in this
hallway, windows, jail office. Someone that was already out in the garage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
part of the basement, I presume, passed back instructions for everybody to
go out and line up on both sides of this hallway affair that comes out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you when you received those instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I was standing in this hallway outside of the jail office windows
there. There is those double doors, swinging doors that come out into the
garage portion of the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you on the garage side of the swinging doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; in the basement proper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long was that before Oswald came down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I couldn't be definite on that, but it wasn't very long, possibly
10 minutes. I don't believe it could have been any longer than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, then, where did you go to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. From the basement proper, after the orders was passed back
to go outside and line up on both sides, I got on what would be the north side
of this little hallway in the garage portion of the basement, where the ramp
comes in, through the hallway that comes out there, I was on the north side
of that and would be on the east side of the door that goes into the jail
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were you keeping an eye out in the basement for people
who might obstruct Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Pardon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you keeping a look, a watch out, from your position for
people who might try to obstruct Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I was kind of watching the crowd and that, but as far as having
a feeling that anything was going to happen <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were watching the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. As to orders to do any particular thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was the crowd that you were watching?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. They were across the ramp that goes down through there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were they up against the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Part of them were up against the railing, part of them, the
best I remember, on the east side of the railing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how about, were the people strung across the Main Street
ramp from the direction of the jail house, the jail office, to the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The best I remember, there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, how many lines deep would you say there were of
people along&mdash;crossing the Main Street ramp on the north side just before
Oswald came out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I recall of people being there, but as to how many rows there
were or a definite number of people, it would be hard to say. The only thing
on that that I could say definitely was that there were people there, and
as to how many, it would just be next to impossible to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as Pierce's car came out, what did you do? As Pierce's
car came out of the garage, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I didn't do anything that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you look at it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I remember seeing a car going out the wrong way up to Main
Street, but as far as looking in <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you watch it go up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; because once it passes this wall there, it passes out of view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you keep an eye on the newsmen in that area as they
re-formed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I am sure I did, but looking over the crowd and everything, it
would be hard not to see them re-form, or whatever you call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was Blackie Harrison standing when Pierce's car went
out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I didn't see Officer Harrison that I remember when this car drove
out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Officer Harrison at any time down in the basement
after you took your position along the north wall just outside of the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It is possible that I did, but as far as remembering seeing him
or saying anything to him after that, I couldn't say definitely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you what I have marked for purposes of
identification as Miller Exhibits 5013 and 5014. Now, Exhibit 5013 is a copy of a
report made by FBI Agents Wilkinson and Hardin of an interview that they
had with you on December 3, 1963, and Exhibit 5014 is a copy of a statement
that you made or a letter that you addressed to Chief Curry on November 26,
1963, entitled, "Subject: Shooting of Harvey Oswald." I am going to ask you
to take these and go out into the other office and look them over and then let
me know whether there are any additions, corrections, changes of any sort that
you would want to make in those.</p>

<p>(Recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. For your purposes, Mr. Ward, may I say that we have Mr L.&nbsp;D.
Miller back with us.</p>

<p>And have you had a chance to look over Exhibits 5013 and 5014?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To your recollection, are those accurate reports of&mdash;looking at
5013, the FBI report, is that an accurate report of what you told the FBI at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, there is part of it in here that is a little confusing. It
could mean one thing and then it could mean another. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember that interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And are you able to state from your memory whether that is
an accurate report of what you told them at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. There is one part in here. Let me find it. It was, when the
officers were sent to the ramp area prior to Oswald being brought down, there
were officers stationed on both sides of the ramp. The officers that came down
were stationed on both sides of the ramp. I don't recall telling the FBI that
there were already officers stationed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Let me see if there was some way you can mark that
on there. Where is this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you want to take this, take my pen, and amend that so
that it reflects what your best recollection is that you told them at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Let's see. Where do you want me to put it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You can either write it down <span class="locked">below&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. The whole thing would have to be reworded. This like this makes
more sense to me what I told them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. You have written there, "The officers that were sent
to the ramp area prior to Oswald being brought down were stationed on both
sides of the ramp." Were you present when the instructions were given to the
officers generally as to where to go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. To line up on both <span class="locked">sides&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Of the ramp area where Oswald was to be brought through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Were you present at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who gave those instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what you were told to do, if anything, when
Oswald got to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I wasn't told what to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, are there any other corrections that you want to make
in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes. "Miller said he had no other pertinent information concerning
the shooting of Oswald." I wasn't asked if I had any more information
to give to them. I answered their questions, the questions they asked me. They
did not ask me if I had any other pertinent information to add.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Would you change that on there, then, and state,
cross that out, and put something through there and say, "I was not asked if
I had pertinent information"? Now, did you in fact at that time have pertinent
information, other than what they asked you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. None that I knew of. It is like now. It could be possible that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
you would ask me a question that I would remember something other than
what I have told you, but I wouldn't know what it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you have any other corrections that you want to make
on this FBI report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Everything else on it looks like it is just about the way it should
be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you, then, initial the corrections that you have made on
here and date it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Where do you want it initialed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any other place, right next to it. And will you initial the
other correction, date it?</p>

<p>Now, directing your attention to Exhibit 5014, and is that a true and accurate
copy of the letter that you wrote to Chief Curry on November 26?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, would you sign that letter and date it, sign the piece of
paper somewhere down there near the bottom and date it, and would you sign
over here on Exhibit 5013, the point where I identified the document, would you
write, sign your name, and date it?</p>

<p>Now, let me ask you one final thing. I take it that you have told us everything
at this time that you can remember about the events that I have questioned
you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you have mentioned everything to us at this point that you
can remember which you think is pertinent to our investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Everything that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, if anything else in the future comes to your attention that
you think might be pertinent to this investigation, would you come forward
and tell us about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes; sure will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Do you want me to call you, if I check, bring the book up to the
office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I am sure I did work that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you would, bring the book to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I wouldn't be allowed to bring the book out of the office. It carries
the duties time. Everybody's name is in the same book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. If you would, call us and let us know the pertinent
details.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="WJN">TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM J. NEWMAN</h2>

<p>The testimony of William J. Newman was taken at 11 p.m., on March 25,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Newman, my name is Burt Griffin. I am a member of the
advisory staff of the general counsel's office of the President's Commission
on the Assassination of President Kennedy. This Commission was set up
pursuant to an Executive order of President Johnson on November 29th, 1963,
and under a joint resolution of Congress, No. 137. The Commission has
prescribed a set of rules of procedure. Pursuant to those rules I have been
authorized to take your sworn deposition.</p>

<p>I want to tell you a little bit about what the general nature of the inquiry
is. Of course, this was set up, as you know, after President Kennedy was
assassinated and Lee Oswald died. Our instructions are to investigate, evaluate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
and report back to President Johnson on all the facts surrounding the assassination
of the President and the murder of Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Now, that includes going into the background of Oswald and Ruby, their associations
and their motives anything that you can think of about them. We
have no authority to send anybody to jail, except for perjury. We are not
like the grand jury, in the sense if we find a crime, and we are not conducting
this examination with the thought that anybody else is going to use this information
to prosecute for crimes of anybody except for perjury.</p>

<p>The most important motivating force, I think, in this investigation is one of
national security, not only from the standpoint of finding out as much as
we can so that we can learn how to prevent all of the occurrences that have
taken place in the last four months from ever happening again, but also, so
we can determine if there is any possibility that there was more than one
person involved with either one of these two men.</p>

<p>Now, we have asked you to appear here primarily to develop facts in connection
with the murder of Oswald, but if you have any sort of information
that would be relevant to the entire scope of our investigation, we would like
to have it.</p>

<p>Now, in particular you have been asked to appear here by virtue of a general
request which was made by the General Counsel of the Commission, Mr. J.
Lee Rankin, to Chief Curry, a letter was sent to Chief Curry and a whole list
of names was on that letter, and we indicated that we were going to examine
these people. Under the rules of the Commission, you are entitled to receive
3-day written notice personally from the Commission, and that hasn't been sent
to you. However, you may waive that notice, and some people insist on it and
others don't. It doesn't make any difference to us, but I would ask you now
whether you would like us to give you the written notice or whether you are
willing to waive the written notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I will be willing to waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I notice that you don't have an attorney here, and that
you are also permitted to have an attorney in any appearance before us, and
if you have any thought that this would be something that you think would
be desirable, don't hesitate to say so, because, again, many people have had
attorneys here, even down here in Dallas, and we would be happy to go home
and go to bed tonight and take up at a more convenient time.</p>

<p>Do you want an attorney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I am going to ask you to raise your right hand and be
sworn.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. William J. Newman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And when were you born, Mr. Newman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. January 31, 1937.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. My street address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. 10923 Cotillion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Cotillion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. [Nods head.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what's your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I am a mechanical engineer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Ling-Temco-Vought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Ling-Temco&mdash;L-i-n&mdash;[spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. L-i-n-g T-e-m-c-o V-o-u-g-h-t [spelling]. Three words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been employed there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Approximately 6 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, are you also a member of the Dallas Police Reserve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been a member of the police reserve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, 18 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I ask you, are you a graduate engineer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many years of education have you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I had a year and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of college?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. College education.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you attend college?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Arlington State.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that at Arlington, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that right here in the general area of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes; it's midway between Dallas and Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what kind of courses did you take at Arlington State?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Just general engineering courses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been employed at Ling-Temco-Vought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. About 6 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And, can you tell us something about the nature of your duties
with your employer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I'm a design engineer and lead man. I am responsible for
four or five draftsmen on a given project.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you mean you are a design engineer; what sort of
things do you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, it's mechanical design of high-power transmitters, radar
transmitters, mostly, electronic circuits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you put things on drawing boards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you work from plans that other people draw up or plans
that other people conceive, or are you responsible to come up with ideas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I work from an electrical schematic, and I am responsible for
the mechanical design and supervision of the other men, to make sure this work
is carried out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you work under a graduate engineer of some sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you go through a training program before you became
a member of the police reserves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long was that training program?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Approximately 9 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how often did you go to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. It was 2 hours a night, 1 night a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any compensation in connection with your services
on the police reserves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why does anyone want to be a member of the police reserve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, civic responsibility, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any little side benefits of any sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, yes. You mean in the way of favors, this type of thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; I don't know, not necessarily that, but <span class="locked">what&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I enjoy it because I do office work, indoors, and this is a way of
getting out, little something to break the routine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there favors and what not that you can get on account of
this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Oh, outside of maybe being overlooked of a traffic violation, I
don't know of any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don't want you to paint yourself too good in this way, because
we had one guy who came in here and painted himself real good, and found out
that he was making a mistake. Maybe I am a great skeptic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, it's like I say, in my case I have always been interested
in law enforcement and it is an outlet, hobby, so to speak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to say this, I finished interviewing Captain Arnett, and
I found him to be a very fine gentleman, so on the basis of my experience, I
don't have any reason to make these comments. Now, were you on duty with
the reserves the day President Kennedy was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I was that evening. That was some 6 or 7 hours after the
assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. What time did you come on duty Friday evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. 7 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got to the police station, who did you report to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. To Lieutenant Merrell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you then assigned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I was then assigned to ride observation with the Radio Patrol
Squad 113.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did riding observation consist of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, this is our normal assignment. We don't normally take
part in police activities unless we are directed by a regular officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you were riding around in the district someplace?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did this permit the regular officer to be relieved for other duties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No, it didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you have had to come in on Friday night anyhow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, on Saturday night, on Saturday, were you at the police
department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; none at all Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On Sunday, did you come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, how did you happen to get called in on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I was called by Sergeant Sullivan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About what time do you believe Lieutenant Merrell called you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. It was approximately 8:30 or 9 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you fix that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I just say&mdash;I suppose it took me approximately an hour to get
down there and I arrived about 9:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were called in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. 8:30 or 9 in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, prior to the time that he called you in the morning, had you
heard anything about the possibility of moving Lee Oswald to the county jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, I knew he would be, of course, but I didn't know what
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Incidentally, on Friday night, were you on the third floor at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; not at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember when you came in on Sunday where you parked
your automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes; I parked it across the street from the police garage on
Canton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. On Canton, C-a-n-t-o-n [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And, is that north, south, east, or west of <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. It's immediately south of the downtown area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how far from Commerce Street; how many blocks from
Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. As I recall, I think it's 3 blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And is a police garage there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you walk up Harwood?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you recall what entrance you entered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I entered Commerce Street door that leads into the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you have any recollection of whether there were any
TV wires strung through there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes; there was a large van parked on Commerce Street, on the
corner of Commerce and Harwood, and there was all kinds of cables. I don't
recall whether there were any going in that door or not. There might have been,
possibly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any TV cables coming down the Commerce Street
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe you spent some time after you were placed on duty
over in the garage area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And, as I understand it, close to Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you were guarding the door to the enginerooms, in that
general area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, the first thing, when I first got there, I was assigned to
help search the automobiles that were parked in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; I want to get to that. I am going to go a little backwards
on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to get the questioning. Where you were finally stationed
prior to the time Oswald was shot, was that near the entrance, the doorway to
the engineroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I am going to get a map, diagram here, and I would like
for you to try to think back to that. I am going to mark this Newman Exhibit
5037. Now, Mr. Newman, this is a copy of the diagram of the basement
area of the Police and Court Building in Dallas. I will try to explain it to you,
and then if you have any questions, why, I will try to answer those. But you
see in this area is the jail office, Harwood is off in this direction. There is
Main, there is Commerce [indicating]. Now, this dotted line here running
parallel to Commerce Street is actually the outside wall above ground level,
and here would be Commerce Street, if you were at ground level, here would
be the sidewalk, here would be the outside wall. However, when you are in the
basement, this diagram purports to represent anyhow, that the basement wall
is this solid black line over here, and I presume that that's true, although I
have never checked it myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. It looks to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do&mdash;these other black marks around here represent posts
[indicating]. Now, would you indicate on this diagram where it was that you
were stationed by&mdash;well, where it was you were stationed in connection with
the security of the basement, after the search of the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I was placed right at the place of this column. There is what
this is, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Do you want me <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Just an "X" there [indicating]. Now, as you were standing
there, do you remember whether any TV cables ran through that general area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. There were none there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There were none. Were there any TV cables that you could
see in the garage area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. By the garage area, you are talking about this area here
[indicating]? I didn't see any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there is an arrow here that says "to engineroom." Are
you familiar with&mdash;is there a door over in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Not a door as such. I don't believe it can be closed. It's just
an opening there [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is an opening?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you can walk into the engineroom there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right. Actually walk&mdash;in fact, I didn't even know it
was there until that morning, but you can walk onto a landing here and then
down. The engineroom is some 5 or 10 feet lower than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you stand in that general area all the time, from the time
that Sergeant Dean placed you there until Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; there was one time when I was called back into the
assembly room, back over here. I think they needed some men somewhere else.
They picked four or five men and then I was returned to this place [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before Oswald was shot would you estimate that you
were pulled off this spot temporarily?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Oh, it must have been 45 minutes to an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. How long were you away from the area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Five minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Let me mark on here pulled off for 5 minutes, 45 minutes
to 1 hour before Oswald shot [indicating]. Did anybody replace you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; they didn't&mdash;I better not make that statement. I am not
sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I want to go back and pick things up from the time you
entered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what time was it when you arrived down there at the
building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Approximately 9:30 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I went to the assembly room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain in the assembly room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Just long enough to have my name in the unit taken down on
the roster.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Lieutenant Merrell called you, did he tell you why you
were to come down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. He said that Oswald was to be transferred at 10 o'clock, that
they expected some crowds downtown and they thought they would need our help,
or a crowd was gathering, I think is what&mdash;the way he had actually said it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall his telling you the time would be 10 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I happened to remember it because I had to rush to get down
there in time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got down there, did you receive any instructions
from somebody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. He and I walked out into the garage area there and we talked
to some&mdash;to Sergeant Dean then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had the search of the garage already begun when you arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do in connection with the search?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I searched&mdash;well, we looked inside all the automobiles. We
checked to make sure the trunk was locked, that the hood was securely latched,
and this general area right in here, there were three or four of us working that
area in there [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you are talking now about the Commerce Street half of
the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What else did you do besides search the cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That was it, until I was assigned to that post.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you see what Sergeant Dean did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I didn't. The only time I remember seeing him, they
found a sporting type rifle in a car somewhere. I think it was later identified as
belonging to one of the officers. I saw him walking out with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, during the period you were standing there in the garage,
were you able to look over in the direction of the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you see, during the period that you were in the garage,
any automobiles moved out of the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you remember when the armored car came down&mdash;was
brought down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I didn't even know it was there. I couldn't see it from
my location. Well, the armored car wasn't brought down the ramp. It was just
backed to the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there ever a time that you were aware there was an armored
car up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Not until after the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Standing where you were standing was there anything that
happened, what you would estimate, a half hour before Oswald was shot, that
would be significant to fix the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; the only thing I can recall at all, there was a pop-type
noise in that area there. I found out later, when they opened the door to the
armored car a soft drink bottle had rolled out and broken. That caused quite a
commotion among the reporters and some of them went up the ramp to see what
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before you heard that pop-type noise, do you remember anything
else before that that might be significant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No. Other than the movement of the cars and the men in
there, I can't recall anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, directing your attention then to the pop-type noise, did
you see any cars moved out of the basement after you heard the pop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes; I am almost certain a car did leave after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Saw a car leave or more than one car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. One is all I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was that car parked, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, I am not too sure of that. I think it was parked in this
area just to the bottom of this small ramp here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you mark on the map where you think that was? You
want to mark car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you see that car move to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, if its the one I am thinking about, they turned and went
out the Main Street side. I recall there was a car came in. I think it was a
squad that had a prisoner. I don't recall it leaving. It may have. I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you recall a car coming in, before or after that car
went out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. It must have been before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say must have been, because somebody has told you that a
car went out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; but I am sure&mdash;I do recall this car left&mdash;oh, not over 5
or 10 minutes, if that long, before Oswald was brought in, and I do know that
no other car left after that, or entered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, do you remember two cars being moved out of the
garage up behind the armored van?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I recall one that was parked right here. I don't remember
whether there were two or not, but there was definitely one parked right here
on the level part of the ramp [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see where that came from; where that car came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't recall, but I think it came from the parking area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you didn't see it moved out of the parking area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. If I did, I don't recall. I am sure I did, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Sergeant Dean placed you in the basement, did you recall
where he placed any of the other men?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I don't. The only one I remember was there was a regular
officer&mdash;I don't know who he was. He was in this approximate area here.
Do you want me to mark this [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; go ahead. Why don't you put a "R" for regular?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall whether there were any officers over here by
elevators Nos. 1 and 2 and the service elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I am almost certain there weren't any in the garage area, except
he and I, immediately prior to the shooting. There was quite a few
moving around through there before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before that were they moving around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Oh, I would say an hour before that, they were moving in and
out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But let's take the 10 or 15 minutes before the shooting. Were
there any men over by those elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Not except the one man. I assume that was his job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The one man you have marked here with an "R"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were you able to tell whether these elevators No. 1 and
No. 2 were in operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; there is no way I had of knowing. I could see the elevators,
but I don't know whether they were in operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see anybody go up or down those elevators in the hour
that you were at your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you able to tell whether or not this service elevator was
in operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That I don't know either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see anybody in that service elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you able to state positively that there was nobody, during
the period you were here, who you saw in that service elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No. I couldn't say that. I just say I couldn't see anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you, during the time you were stationed here, did you
see anybody come out of the engineroom area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you able to tell from where you were stationed if there
was anybody in there, a night watchman or anybody in that engineroom there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No. I couldn't see if there was anybody in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, in the 20 minutes or half hour before the shooting, how
many cars would you say were parked in this part of the garage [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Oh, I would estimate there were 20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, in that half hour before the shooting, was there any traffic
in and out of that garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Just that one squad, that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, from the time that you heard that Coke bottle drop, where
was your attention focused, from your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. At the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Oh, from the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. What were you looking at in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, my main concern was this room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I was looking occasionally throughout the rest of the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you tell us how you faced from there, from where you
have got yourself, what direction you were facing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I was facing in this direction [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have occasion at any time to look over in this area
here [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Not until immediately prior to the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What directed your attention over there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Someone yelled, "Here he comes." I believe, "Here they come,"
something to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you could hear that from over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. [Witness nods head.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how about when you saw an automobile move out of the
garage? Did you follow that automobile&mdash;did you watch and see where that
automobile went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Not from the time it got on the ramp. I couldn't see but about
two thirds of the ramp. I couldn't see the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, after that automobile left, did you continue to
watch over in that direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No. There was nothing unusual about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Prior to the time, or as the automobile was moving out, can
you describe this area, in what I will call the entrance to the garage, describe
how many people were in that area there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Oh, I would estimate there were 40, 50, 60 people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were there substantially more people in the area in the
garageway than in the area along the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; there were more people over in this area here, along
this wall [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many people would you estimate were <span class="locked">over&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, that's what I meant, I would say over 40 or 50, total.
Out of that, I wouldn't think there were more than 5 or 10, if that many, in
this area here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you mark down here the placement of the people in that
area at the time you heard somebody yell, "Here he comes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. You just want to know about this one area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't recall specifically anyone being there at any particular
place [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, over in this area, can you show me how they
were placed over there [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. There was a group along this wall, there was a group over here
that I could see [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what's your estimate of the number of people that were
in this group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Oh, from what I could see, I would say maybe 20, just an
estimate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't you put about 20 there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. [Indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how many people would you estimate were over in this
cluster that you have marked there [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. From what I could see, it appeared to be about the same
number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About 20 there. And, how many deep were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Oh, I couldn't see that much detail. I could just tell there
was a crowd of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, would you try to indicate how people were spaced over
in here [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, if there were, they were very sparse. I would just say
individually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, why don't you just write in there "sparse."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. [Indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where the TV cameras were placed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you indicate on that where the TV cameras were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. As I recall, there were three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you came into the basement the first time, did
you see a TV camera over in this area here that I have pointed to [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Not a large camera. There may have been a hand-held camera,
but no large camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am indicating on here, so the record will reflect, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
pointing to the area roughly in front of the jail office door. For anyone reading
this, I will indicate also that this is an area in which Assistant Chief Batchelor
indicated that sometime, that he is not sure of, in the early morning he saw
a TV camera there, and he believes he had it moved. Now, I take it you don't
recall any equipment of any sort being in this area in here, in the garage
[indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. TV equipment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. In the entrance to the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is this a railing, incidentally [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. This is a small rail right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Let me write across here "rail." Now, from where
you were standing, were you able to see over that rail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Partially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How high is that rail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. It isn't over 3 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it a solid thing or is it a metal <span class="locked">set&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Just made of pipes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it any different from the railings that's along the Commerce
Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Same type railing, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Same type of railing. And the railing that's marked in solid
on the other side of the entrance to the garage next to the chief parking area,
which I will also label rail, that's the same kind of railing as the ones over near
the TV cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, your vision from where you were standing was not substantially
obstructed by any permanent parts of the building, from where the
marked curb on the ramp is, all the way down, perhaps to this, all the way
down to this railing here [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. It was somewhat obstructed by these columns, but nothing
to keep me from getting an overall view of the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what do you recall happening after the automobile drove
out of the drive and went up the Commerce Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't recall anything until I heard that "Here he comes,"
called out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do when you heard the "Here he comes"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I looked up in that direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what did you see when you looked up in that direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. All I saw was the newsmen congregating to that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did they seem to be pushing in from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, they were making a round in this general area in here
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are indicating the area up in the ramp, Main Street
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How deep were they in the Main Street ramp, by that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I would guess two or three, but that's just a guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, does that include policemen, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. You mean the number of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you say the total number of people was two or three
deep there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it solid across from this wall to the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, I couldn't see that much detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as you looked over in that direction, after you heard
"Here he comes," and you saw this milling around, what is the next thing
that you remember seeing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, like I said, I saw these people congregating to this
area. I did see a man come down this ramp [indicating].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You saw a man come down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you see him come down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. It was just immediately after that was called out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And whereabouts did you first see him when he was on the
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Oh, I would say in about the location of this arrow [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to put a mark there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. [Indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you see that man do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. He just ran down in here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he seem to run down into the center or to one side or
what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. From the angle I was looking, I couldn't tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you see that man&mdash;how that man was dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see that man emerge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Jack Ruby move forward at Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you were standing here, could you see the areaway here
[indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't think I could because of the car that was parked here.
I don't recall seeing the area. I don't recall not seeing it. I don't much think
I could, though, because there was a car parked right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. I am going to mark this in pencil. Is that about where
this car was [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I would say it was just about that location [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. And is the way we have got this drawn here at this
point, with the one pencil mark in there, the way the area from here on up, all
the way up to here and the whole building appeared at the time Oswald was
shot, from this spot [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's the way it appeared to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us anything about that area there [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No. I do remember one thing, now, that was&mdash;some half hour
before that, where another automobile was parked, if you are interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. It was parked, I would say, approximately here. I will mark
this "second auto"; is that all right [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Just mark it "car one half hour before shooting."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. All right [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was that car there at the time that Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; it wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you see that car moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't recall it being moved. It might possibly have been the
car that left here. I do know there was a car over here. I wasn't paying that
much attention as to what they were doing. This might possibly have been
this car; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are not sure where the car that went up the ramp came
from, but you did see a car go up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see this car that moved through the line of newsman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Not that I recall. I didn't pay any attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. You have indicated that this car you saw move out,
moved out 5 or 10 minutes before the shooting. Now, I know it's awful difficult,
we have been here talking, and I frankly haven't any idea how long we have
talked. Maybe it is easier to pinpoint the movement of that car in terms of
when you heard that pop bottle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. All I know, it was sometime between the bottle and the shooting.
I would say I can't pinpoint it even within 10 minutes, but I do know it
was a short time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. I will mark this, "Exhibit, Dallas, Texas, W.&nbsp;J. Newman,"
no; I take that back. I will mark it, but I think it best that we go through this
whole thing chronologically. W.&nbsp;J. Newman, 3-25-64, Exhibit 5038. Now, what
did you do after the shot was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. As soon as I heard the shot fired, I ran up into this place
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don't think we need to mark it. You stood at the base of the
garage ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, this officer came up to about&mdash;well, opposite <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To make this, maybe, a little easier, let's take the pencil and
you mark where you went to with pencil, and draw a line to it, and then mark
where this other fellow went. Why don't you put an arrow, so we know which
direction we are moving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. (Indicating).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Do you remember what the name of that officer was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do as you got up to that spot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, he or I, neither one had anyway of knowing what had
happened, other than the fact a shot had been fired, and he said, "Don't let anyone
leave." There was a man came at me from this direction, running towards
me. I stopped him [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Was he a newspaper man or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. He later told me he was a member of one of these camera crews.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do with him when you stopped him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. We scuffled a couple of seconds there until he recognized I was
a police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you in uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes. And as I recall, he said, "I am not trying to leave. I
will stay with you. I just want to get away from there," or something to that
effect. He didn't stand there but for a minute. Then he asked me if he could
go back to the crew. I told him he could, but not to try to leave the building.
I still didn't know what had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why would he run off in that direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't know. There was a man crouched behind this column
here [indicating]. I assumed, I still do, he was probably just trying to find
some place to go. Those columns offered the most protection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how long did you remain there after you stopped that
man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Until the ambulance arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you describe this man that you stopped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I can't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever learn what TV crew he was from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after the ambulance came, did you continue to remain
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I moved up to the base of the Commerce ramp here. There
was another officer in plain clothes here&mdash;some newsmen tried to follow the
ambulance out and we stopped them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. That was a plain clothes officer, I think you said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I think we stopped him. He showed us his identification and
he went on up the ramp. Not more than, oh, 2 or 3 minutes after that, I assume
they decided to let these men go where they wanted to. I don't know
that for a fact, but at any rate I was sent out on the corner of Main and Harwood
to direct traffic. There were quite a few police units coming in from
different parts of town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain out on the corner of Main and
Harwood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Not over 10 minutes. A motorcycle officer relieved me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Then I returned to the assembly room and I was sent out
to Parkland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About what time did you arrive out at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't know exactly. From what happened, I would say
12:15 to 12:30, but that's just an approximation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I was there until about 4:30 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to anybody out there at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I talked to quite a few officers there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you stationed at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I was right on the entrance where you turn into the hospital
off of Harry Hines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what police officers you talked to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't recall any except Captain Solomon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at the time you were out there, did you tell anybody
about having seen this man come down the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; at the time I didn't place any significance on it, because
I still didn't know what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you were standing out there, did you hear any
discussion about the name of the man who had shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Not there. The officer who relieved me on the traffic detail
there on the corner asked me if I knew it was Jack Ruby that had done it. That
was all he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was that officer that relieved you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't know his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That was at 4 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; it was at&mdash;oh, 12:15 or 12:30, on the corner of Harwood
and Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, by the time you got to Parkland Hospital, you knew Ruby
had shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I knew a man named Jack Ruby had shot him. The name
didn't mean anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you relieve Officer Vaughn at the Main Street entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Oh, you went to Main and Harwood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right; I did. On the way back I did spend, oh, maybe
5 minutes here at this entrance [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Directing traffic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And was Officer Vaughn there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't recall the officer's name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got out to Parkland Hospital, did you tell anybody
out there the name of the person who shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember some of the officers who were out there at
Parkland Hospital? By this, I mean reserve officers as well as regular officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't recall anyone by name except Captain Solomon. I
haven't been in the reserve long enough to know too many of these men. I
know there were 5 reserves&mdash;or 4 others and myself, who were transported
out there in the squad car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don't know any of the reserve officers by name, outside of
Solomon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Oh, yes; I know them, but I don't know any of those people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Had you ever worked before with any of the reserve
officers who were out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I had gone through school with one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which one was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. There again, I can't tell you his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you describe him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. He was&mdash;I would know his name if I saw it. Oh, rather
tall, I would say about 6'2", wavy black hair, medium built.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does he wear glasses?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what he does, where he is employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how old is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I guess late twenties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know where he lives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you see this particular officer out at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. [Witness nods head.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. He relieved me sometime in the middle of the afternoon so I
could go get a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to him about what had happened down there in
the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No. The only thing I said, I just relayed to him the instructions
I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember telling anybody out there about seeing a man
coming down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you think that you did not tell anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I know I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You know you didn't tell anybody that. When did you first
become aware that this might be significant, that you saw this man come down
the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. When I was interviewed by Lieutenant Revill. It must have
been the following Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After you got off duty at Parkland Hospital, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I went back to the Police and Courts Building and was assigned
on the second floor, security detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that where Captain Talbert was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't know the gentleman. It was right outside of the city
planning office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Oh. Was this on the second floor of the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. The Police and Courts Building. The city planning <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that in the jail part of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes. On the second floor, just to the right of the elevator,
there is some city offices there other than the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you were on the elevator, stationed on the elevators there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I was at the stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were you to be doing there at the stairway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. My instructions were that no one was to be in there except
press, police, and anyone who had a business. There were several civilians
who came into the building. I recall one witness who, in accident, he was
escorted into where he was going and escorted out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Until about 8:30 p.m. About 2 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I was relieved and went home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, while you were there, did you talk to Sergeant
Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, no; but I didn't see Sergeant Dean the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At any time before you left duty, did anybody from the police
department talk to you about writing a report or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, while you were standing around there before you left
duty, did you hear any rumors about how Jack Ruby got in the building?
What was the first rumor that you heard about how Ruby got in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. The first I heard was not over 2 weeks ago in an account in
a newspaper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don't understand. It was not over 2 weeks ago in an
<span class="locked">account&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. An article. The first&mdash;anything I had heard, rumor or otherwise,
as to how he got into the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mean 2 weeks ago from today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. During the trial, approximately 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn't hear any rumors over television; didn't read any
rumors in the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, let me retract that. I do recall a statement that Ruby
himself made. I don't remember when it was. It was sometime in the 4 months
between the incident and the trial. I think he had boasted how easy it was,
or he couldn't have planned it that well, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you take a daily newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you take any news magazines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. [Witness shakes head.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Saturday Evening Post?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Read any magazines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes; I read some magazines but no news magazines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I mean, do you subscribe to any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes. American Rifleman and Readers Digest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Those are the only two magazines you subscribe to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you take both daily newspapers in town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you try to keep abreast of the articles on the Ruby killing
of Oswald, after this event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I think I read just about every word that was printed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you didn't see a single rumor in any newspaper about how
he got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I won't say I didn't see it. I will say I don't recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall an article, for example, that was written about
Sergeant Dean, where Sergeant Dean said, was quoted as saying he saw a man
come down the Main Street ramp; do you recall that article?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't. The reason I remember so well is because this article
I saw 2 weeks ago satisfied my curiosity. I had been curious all that time. I
knew from what Lieutenant Leavelle told me, or from the remarks he made,
that with the men with him there&mdash;he wasn't making the remarks to me, but
I think, when I told him about this, he turned to the other men and said, "Well,
that's it." That's the only information I heard. The police officers I worked
with and so forth had been very shut mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When were you first requested to make a statement or prepare
a letter or something of that sort for the use of the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. It was the following Sunday, the week from the day of&mdash;the
day Oswald was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you sure of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. First request?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you what I have marked as Newman Exhibit
No. 5038. Would you read that over [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I am going to have to back up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, this purports to be a copy of a letter which you signed and
was addressed to Chief Curry and dated November 26, 1963. Did you prepare
that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Let me think. The Tuesday night afterwards, Lieutenant Merrell
gave me a mimeographed questionnaire for me to complete and return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
him and I think I did it right there on the spot. It was a very vague type
thing. When I say statement, I am talking about the statement that I did sign
the following Sunday, where they had this information that I had given them
typed in the form of a statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, in this statement you indicated that you saw Lieutenant
Stuets and Lieutenant Crowey&mdash;Sergeant Crowey, of the reserves in the same
area you were in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I saw them that morning. They were not in the same area that
I was in. I had seen them in the basement that morning. I don't have any
idea where they were at the time. I happen to know now where Sergeant
Crowey was, but I found that out later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you see Sergeant Crowey in the basement that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That I don't remember. It was sometime before <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you mean by this statement in here that, "Names of
other officers in the same area that I can't recollect." What do you mean by
the same area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. By the same area there I meant the basement proper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where in the basement do you remember seeing him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sergeant Crowey?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't recall any specific area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where in the basement area did you recall seeing Stuets? Now,
is Lieutenant Stuets or Sergeant Crowey, either one of them, this regular officer
that you have got marked here with an "X"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as far as that is concerned, then, you saw many officers
in here who you would remember, whose names you would remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No. The way I took that question and the way I answered
it, those are the only two officers I saw that morning in the basement whose
names I did remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they help you search the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't believe so. They have been searching in another
area, but they weren't right with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Captain Arnett that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Let me try to&mdash;I know he was there, but I don't think I saw
him. I may have seen him after the shooting. There was so much confusion
then that I wasn't paying too much attention to who I was seeing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know of an officer on the police force named Blackie
Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize Chief Batchelor when you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't think I would. I have only seen the gentleman one
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize Captain Butler when you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize Captain Jones when you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I don't know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize Officer Lowery when you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know any of the officers in the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I would know one if I saw him. I don't know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know Detective Miller in the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you recognize the name of this guy in the juvenile bureau,
if I gave you his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; as far as I know, I have never heard it. I have only
been in there, I think, twice.</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are a d&mdash;- l&mdash;-. I want you to come back tomorrow
night and I want you&mdash;&mdash;I want to question you some more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I certainly don't appreciate that accusation. I have given you
all I can, to the best of my memory, for 4 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want you to regard yourself as still under the obligation to
appear, that you are already under, by virtue of having waived any notice
here, and I would like to recess to continue this deposition until 4 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon in this office. If you would care to consult with an attorney
at that time, or anything like that, and would like to come in here with one,
I would be most happy for you to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. May I ask: What are you getting at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, frankly, after having sat here for an hour and having
listened to this testimony, my own personal opinion, either you are absolutely
not telling the truth or plenty of other people who have been in here aren't
telling the truth. Somehow I am going to see how the devil we can reconcile
these differences.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="WJNR">TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM J. NEWMAN RESUMED</h2>

<p>The testimony of William J. Newman was taken at 4:08 p.m., on March 26,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that at 4:08, March 26, 1964, the deposition
of Mr. W.&nbsp;J. Newman, which was commenced last night with Mr. Burt W.
Griffin conducting the investigation, but which was not completed last night,
is now being resumed by Leon D. Hubert, Jr., staff member, conducting the
deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Newman, are you willing to continue the deposition at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you understand that you are under the same oath that
you were yesterday when the deposition began, and all through the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that you regard yourself as being under the same oath?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show, also, that I have been designated by Mr. J.
Lee Rankin, General Counsel of the Commission, to take the sworn deposition
of Mr. William J. Newman.</p>

<p>Mr. Newman, I simply want to mark for identification so that we will all
know what we are talking about certain papers and letters and reports so that
we can refer to them by the designation marked on them.</p>

<p>Now, I notice that last night, apparently, the last exhibit number that was
used by Mr. Griffin was No. 5038, in connection with a letter dated November
26, or rather it is a copy of a letter dated November 26 addressed to J.&nbsp;E. Curry,
Chief of Police, the original of which, apparently, signed W.&nbsp;J. Newman.</p>

<p>Since I do not know what sequence of the letters Mr. Griffin has used since
he started your deposition, I am going to number the documents that we will be
talking about now by using the same basic number 5038, adding the letters
"A", "B", "C", etc., as far as we need to go. Now, in that connection, I am
marking an undated statement&mdash;an undated document, I beg your pardon, undated
document entitled "Statement of Police Reserve Officer William J.
Newman." It is also unsigned. And it is to be found in the Commission Document
81-A point 79. For the purpose of identification, I am marking it "Dallas,
Tex., March 26, 1964. Exhibits 5038-A. Deposition of W.&nbsp;J. Newman." Sign
my name below it. Then for the purposes of identification, also, I am marking
a verifax or photostatic copy of "Officer's Memorandum dated December 6,
1963, to Lieutenant Revill, from Detective R.&nbsp;W. Westphal," which document
is to be found in Commission Document 81-A point 79. And, I am marking that
"Dallas, Tex., March 26, 1964. That's Exhibit 5038-B. Deposition of W.&nbsp;J.
Newman," and signing my name below on that document. Then the next document<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
is a letter, or verifax or photostatic copy of a letter, dated December 31,
1963, to J.&nbsp;E. Curry, signed by Jack Revill, and C.&nbsp;C. Wallace, purporting to be
a report on an interview by Reserve Officer W. J.&mdash;William J. Newman, No. 317,
and for the purposes of identification I am marking that document "Dallas,
Tex., March 26, 1964. Exhibit No. 5038-C." Continuing your identification,
"Dallas, Tex., March 26, 1964, Exhibit 5038-C. Deposition of W.&nbsp;J. Newman."
I am signing my name on that document, which is also to be found in Commission
Report&mdash;Commission Document No. 81-A point 79. Finally, I am marking what
purports to be a copy of the report by FBI Agents James C. Kennedy and Leo L.
Robertson, concerning an interview with William J. Newman on December 24,
1963, and for identification I am marking that document, "Dallas, Tex., March
26, 1964. Exhibit 5038-D. The deposition of W.&nbsp;J. Newman." And signing
my name on that document.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Newman, you have had an opportunity, I think, to read these various
documents there, 5038, then 5038-A, B, C and D.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The only purpose of asking you to read them and to compare
them is to ask you if you can assist us at getting at the facts, and that is all
we want to know.</p>

<p>There seems to be some contradiction between them. Maybe there is not. If
there isn't and you can show us that there isn't, that is all we want to know.
If there is a contradiction, we would like to have your explanation, if we can,
as to what is the truth, because that is all we want to know anyhow. If there
is a contradiction, it is obvious that one of the statements must be wrong, and
all we want to do is tell us which is wrong and which is right. That is the sole
purpose of this inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Be happy to; if I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Perhaps I can get at it this way: These reports seem to indicate
that you saw a man coming down the ramp. These records also seem to indicate
that you saw a man climbing over a rail in the basement. Now, I think
we can clarify this situation immediately by asking you, do those reports
relate to two different instances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, there was a man climbing over the rail, and there
was a man coming down the Main Street ramp, and as far as you know they are
two different episodes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Two different things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Two different things. All right. We got a lot clarified there.
Now, I think the other point is when did each of these happen, and let's take,
first of all, the man coming down the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. This, as I stated there, was, as near as I can estimate, approximately
1 minute or less prior to the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said in your statement that because of the various
conditions existing you could not identify the man by name or sight or anything
of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say when he was coming down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's correct. I have also&mdash;I have never made any estimate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; that's correct. I didn't mean to intimate that you had. It
is a fact that a man coming down&mdash;that you did see a man coming down, but
you really don't know who he is, and that never have known?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have, of course, seen pictures and so forth of Jack Ruby
since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say that the man coming down the ramp was Jack
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No; I wouldn't. By the same token, I wouldn't say that he
wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you can't say whether he was or wasn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right. I just didn't pay that much attention to it at
the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was definitely about a minute before the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, I think we have that one clarified, so far as that is concerned.</p>

<p>Now, about the man jumping over the rail, what is your best thought about the
timing on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I have none. When I talked to Lieutenant Revill, I think this
was Sunday the 1st of December, I guess it would be, and he asked me two or
three times whether I had seen a man go over the rail. I couldn't recall anyone.
Later, I think it was, oh, two days later, I am not sure, I did remember seeing
someone go over that rail, but as I stated in that statement, I cannot, for the
life of me, set the time in any figures. Just something that registered, and that
was the end of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that when you say "it", you couldn't tell whether it was
before the shooting or after, you can't tell whether it was a minute before or a
minute after, 5 minutes before or 5 minutes after, or for that matter more time
before or more time after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Well, I know not longer than 5 or 10 minutes after, because I
wasn't there. I couldn't establish it at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that your best recollection right now, today, is simply that
you have a recollection of a man going over the rail from the parking area into
the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what part of the ramp was it; do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. About midway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About midway? But, you don't know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. <span class="locked">Just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The relation of it as to time of the shooting, except that it
couldn't have been when you weren't there, obviously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You remember how the man was dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I'll ask you this, too: Do you know whether it was, or was not,
or do you have any opinion on whether it was or was not Jack Ruby, or do you
have any opinion as to who it was at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I have no opinion whatsoever. I would like to say in that,
since we are talking about this incident, that when I talked to Detective Westphal&mdash;was
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Lieutenant Revill was out of town. He didn't indicate to me
that he placed any importance on it whatsoever. I was not aware of the fact
that he had even written a memo on it. Mr. Griffin, last night, did not bring it
up, and I, after talking to him, dropped the subject. Didn't see fit to bring it up,
or didn't even remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is this undated statement which we have identified as
5038-A, the one that is also unsigned? Do you know anything about that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't know. I would guess probably that information was
taken down at the time I talked to him on the telephone. That is, by and large,
the statement I made to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had called him on the telephone as indicated, in fact, by
Exhibit 5038-B, when Westphal reports on it, says, "Subject." That means
you, "called this date." Did he ask you when&mdash;in other words, he left a call for
you, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Now, I called him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You called him to tell him what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Just to give him that information that I had remembered since
I talked to him the previous time, because at the time he seemed to think it was
fairly important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you go out to Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you speak to a man, reserve officer by the name of Holly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I don't recall. I spoke to several reserve officers. I can't
recall any of them as to who they were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember telling anyone of them about having seen
either of these two men that we just talked about, that is to say, the man
coming down the rail, or coming down the ramp, or the man coming over the
rail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No, at the time I didn't even recall placing any significance on
the fact, because at the time I didn't even know what had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't recall talking to anybody about either of these two
episodes, the man going down the ramp and the man jumping over the rail while
you were at Parkland that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather from your statement, but I think I had better get it
exactly straight, that you did not do anything with respect to either of the two
men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No, I had no contact with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I didn't mean that contact, so much as I meant taking some
police action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No, that is what I meant too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Do you know an officer by the name of Brock? Reserve
officer, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No, I don't. I don't recognize the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And one by the name of Worley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No, I don't recognize that name either. I might know him on
sight if I see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, have you any other comments to make? I think the thing
is clarified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No, we had our misunderstanding last night. I didn't know
what needed to be clarified. I know I was thoroughly shaky and possibly not too
accurate as to the details of what happened in that basement prior to the shooting
in the hour or hour and a half, but that wasn't my concern, and I didn't
pay too much attention. I just gave it as best I remembered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I wasn't at the deposition last night, so I don't know what
went on, and I, therefore, will not ask you any further questions.</p>

<p>Have you had any interview with me prior to taking of this deposition today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. I think that is all. Thank you for coming very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. I do have one other thing here that Mr. Griffin seemed to be
concerned about last night, in that I couldn't identify a man, a reserve officer I
had met in the basement of the garage, or immediately after I got there by name.
That that you are holding is a class picture that was made. I can now identify&mdash;I
have a list of names in my pocket if you want them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The only way for it to be of the use would be if you would let
me mark the picture and put it in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. You may have it if you like. I don't know whether it is of
any importance or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don't either, but&mdash;do you want it to go in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Not necessarily. I am leaving it up to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I say, I don't know what the question was last night about
identification, and you have brought this matter up; I am perfectly willing to
hear what you have to say about it. I think it would be better, if you comment
about it, to put it in the record, but on the other hand maybe it wouldn't be
necessary. Why don't you say what you have to say about it and then we can
judge better?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. As near as I can recall, when he was questioning me about
what officers I had seen in the basement that morning whom I knew, and the
subject came up that I had seen one man but I could not remember his name.
He asked me at that time for a description of him and I gave it to him. After
looking at that picture last night when I got home, and with the list of names I
had for the picture, I can now give the man's name, if you would like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Third from the left&mdash;second from the left on the back row.
Casten, Jerome Casten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jerome Casten. Now, that was the reserve officer that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Griffin was questioning you about last night, and, as I understand it, you
testified that you did remember seeing a man, and you gave his description,
but at that time you did not know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With the aid of this picture, which as I understand, is a class
picture&mdash;I see Captain Solomon there, by the way&mdash;you identified him as the
second man in the top row from the left, and you stated his name to <span class="locked">be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. Jerome Casten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jerome Casten. I think it would be better if you would allow
this to go in. I am, therefore, marking the picture on the reverse side thereof
by placing the following on it, to wit: "Dallas, Texas, March 26, 1964. Exhibit
5038-E, deposition of W.&nbsp;J. Newman." Then I am signing my name below that,
I am placing an "X" over the man you have identified, and placing my initials
next to the "X"; is that correct, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. That's right. I don't remember seeing that man throughout
the rest of the day, and to the best of my knowledge he was assigned somewhere
other than the basement quite sometime prior to the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in order that the record may show that we were both
talking about the same document all the time, I wonder if you would mind
placing your name below mine on each one of these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Newman</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="BGP">TESTIMONY OF BOBBY G. PATTERSON</h2>

<p>The testimony of Bobby G. Patterson was taken at 4:07 p.m., on April 14, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Bobby G. Patterson.</p>

<p>Mr. Patterson, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory
staff of the general counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963,
joint resolution of Congress 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the
Commission, in conformance with the Executive order and the joint resolution,
I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you, Mr. Patterson.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission's inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of
President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mr. Patterson, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald, and any other pertinent
facts you may know about the general inquiry, including what you know
about what Jack Ruby might have had to do with it.</p>

<p>Mr. Patterson, I think you have appeared here by virtue of an individual
request made to you to appear here&mdash;was that by a letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. By a letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that letter addressed to you by J. Lee Rankin, General
Counsel of the Commission&mdash;when did you receive it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yesterday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I came back Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any objection to testifying now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The reason I say that is that under the rules of the Commission
a person is supposed to have a 3-day notice before they can be required to testify,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
but the rules also provide that you can waive it if you want to. If you are
willing to testify and waive the 3 days notice, we can go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I am as willing as he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; would you stand up and raise your right hand and I
will administer the oath.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your name, please, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Bobby G. Patterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old are you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Thirty-three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what is your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Mesquite, Tex., 3463 Caracas [spelling] C-a-r-a-c-a-s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your occupation is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Patrolman, Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been on the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Oh, about 5½ years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I worked for American Beauty Flour Co. down here on South
Ervay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Patterson, I have shown you a document which for the
purpose of identification I have marked in the right margin the words, "Dallas,
Tex., April 14, 1964. Exhibit 5311, Patrolman Bobby G. Patterson," and I have
put my name on it, and since it contains a second page, I have put my initials
at the bottom of the second page, and I ask you if you have read that document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That purports to be a report of an interview of you made by
Special Agents Horton and Propst [spelling] P-r-o-p-s-t, on November 30,
1963, does it not; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I believe it is&mdash;I wouldn't say for sure&mdash;it was on Saturday,
I believe&mdash;I don't know when it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, I ask you if you think that this report identified
as Exhibit 5311 is a fair report of the interview that you had with the FBI
agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. It is a fair report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything that you would like to add or delete or modify
with respect to Exhibit 5311?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No, that's just about it. As far as the time, now, I don't
know about some of the time in my report and every report and stuff like
that&mdash;I don't know if that makes any difference or not. That is as near as I
could get it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let me ask you this&mdash;you say you are not sure about the
times that are stated in this report, Exhibit 5311. I take it that you weren't
sure really at the time that they interviewed you; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes&mdash;you know, the correct time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, of course, I note that where this exhibit does mention
time, it says "about."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, that's what I put it, "about."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not know Ruby at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were at the top of the Commerce Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. The ramp; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From about 9:30 on&mdash;you never left it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I never left it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As far as you know, no one unidentified was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No one without proper identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what you understood was meant by "proper identification"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, he said not to let no one in except police and reporters
unless they had proper identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said they told you&mdash;who was that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. The sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sergeant Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, of course, with respect to police, I guess their uniform
would establish their identity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No, they have a regular identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were instructed to have them show their official identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the identification of newsmen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, the best I could tell, they pulled out all the identification&mdash;part
of them had pictures of who they worked for, where they lived, some
of them didn't have nothing, some of them had stickers and I had to turn
one of them back&mdash;I did&mdash;he come up there in a WRR truck and got out of
it but didn't have no identification and he had to go back and get some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, as far as you were concerned, you were not
satisfied if a man just simply had a badge on saying "press"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went further and required something that would satisfy
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes&mdash;anybody can pick up a press badge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you actually turned back some people who claimed to be
the press, but you weren't satisfied with their identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you require a picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Some of them had pictures and some of them didn't&mdash;some
of them had where they lived&mdash;on down further who they worked for and
what press&mdash;and they had cameras on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, if they had that sort of thing, you figured that that was
proper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, it's proper identification&mdash;you know half of them didn't
know they were supposed to have the pictures. Of course, I don't guess the
chief or anybody notified them to have pictures like they did down at the
county.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you considered that the identification you required as
to newsmen, when they didn't have a picture, would be such as would satisfy
you in normal police work in identifying anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Driver's license and things of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, sometimes I would have them show me their driver's
license and that on top of their identification too, to make sure that was the
same person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you stayed in that position I guess from about 9:30 until
<span class="locked">actually&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Almost 12 o'clock, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After the killing&mdash;after the ambulance went through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been given any instructions as to how the transfer was
to take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. All they told me was that he would be transferred by
armored car and for me to stay on the right side of it&mdash;of the armored car&mdash;as
it was being backed in, and I stayed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I have previously handed you another document which I
have marked for identification by writing on the margin as follows: "Dallas,
Texas, April 14, 1964, Exhibit 5312, Deposition of Patrolman Bobby G. Patterson,"
and I have signed my name below.</p>

<p>Now, I show you that document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have seen it and have read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You consider that it is correct and states the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any modifications or adjustments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. It is about as true as I could get it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No deletions or anything to add?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a man by the name of Larry Crafard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Larry Crafard or Curtis Laverne Crafard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have a telephone, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your telephone number, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. BRoadway 9-0394.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you had that number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Oh, about&mdash;almost a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you familiar at all with the telephone number WH-2-5326?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No, sir; I never heard tell of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Robert Carl Patterson,
also known as Bobby Patterson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your middle initial is "G" and that stands for what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Gene [spelling] G-e-n-e.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that you are not a person by the name of Robert Carl
Patterson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever lived at 902 East Waco Street, Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Patterson, I am going to show you a page in an exhibit
which has been re-marked, "Dallas, Texas, April 14, 1964, Exhibit 5308, Deposition
of Andrew Armstrong," on which I have signed my name, and that same
group of pages has also been marked Crafard Exhibit No. 5205, in connection
with the testimony of another witness?</p>

<p>On one of the pages thereof, I show you the number "WH-2-5326, Bobby
[spelling] B-o-b-b-y Patterson." Is that your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. It isn't mine&mdash;no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anything about that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I sure don't&mdash;I haven't heard tell of that number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you been interviewed previous to this time by any member
of the Commission's staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I never have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you; that's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Okay.</p>

<h2 id="RSP">TESTIMONY OF RIO S. PIERCE</h2>

<p>The testimony of Rio S. Pierce was taken at 11:20 p.m., on March 24, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Lt. Rio S. Pierce, with the Dallas Police
Department. Lieutenant Pierce, my name is Leon D. Hubert, Jr. I am a member
of the advisory staff of the general counsel on the President's Commission.
Under the provisions of the Executive Order No. 11130, dated November 29, 1963,
the joint resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted
by the Commission in conformance with the Executive order and that joint
resolution, I have been authorized to take the sworn deposition from you,
Lieutenant Pierce. I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission's
inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee
Harvey Oswald. In particular to you, Lieutenant Pierce, the nature of the
inquiry today is to determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald
and any other pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry. Lieutenant
Pierce, you have appeared today by virtue of a general request made to
Chief Curry by J. Lee Rankin, the General Counsel of the Commission. Under
the rules adopted by the Commission you are entitled to have a 3-day written
notice prior to the taking of the deposition, but the rules also provide that you
may waive that 3-day written notice if you see fit to do so, and I ask <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I waive that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. May I ask you to stand and raise your right hand so that you
can be sworn? Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your name?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Rio S. Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Age?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Forty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence, please?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. 3227 South Edgefield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Police officer, city of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long have you been so occupied?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. About 17 1/2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you held the rank of lieutenant?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Four years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were your specific duties and responsibilities on November
24, 1963?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Do you have reference to normal duties, or on this specific
day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On this specific day.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. On this specific day I had instructions to secure the basement
of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From whom did you receive those instructions?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. From Captain Talbert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is he one of your superior officers?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes; captain of the radio patrol, lieutenant commander
<span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did he give you those orders, sir?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I would say about 9 to 9:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he direct you as to what you were to do in order to secure
the basement area?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No, sir; other than securing enough men from the other
stations to secure the basement properly and make arrangements for whatever
manpower was needed for the transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Would you state for the record what you actually did
in connection with carrying out those orders?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Well, while we were responsible for the routine work of
the department, we had to determine what manpower would be pulled on the
various substations that we had, and those men were called in to the central
station to be used as they were needed. Sergeant Dean was assigned the security
of the basement, and he was assisted by Sergeant Putnam, and as I recall,
there was a total of about 19 men that were called off their districts to help in
this work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you, yourself, do any of the inspection work, or the searching
out work?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No, sir; Sergeant Dean made the assignment of the men,
and approximately an hour later, I guess maybe 10:15, I did make an inspection
of the basement, and apparently everything had been checked out, and it was
considered secure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did your inspection consist of at the time?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Looking over the basement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you walk around?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir; I walked around the basement and checked
various entrances to the city hall basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a reserve officer by the name of Brock?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I can't recall right now. I know the name, I am sure
that I know him by sight, but I don't connect the name with the person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice that there had been placed a uniformed officer,
reserve or otherwise, near the service elevator in the basement?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Are you talking about in the new building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, sir; the elevator that goes up into the municipal building.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. As well as I remember, there was an officer. I believe
his name was Brock. A police officer by the name of Brock. I'm not certain,
but those elevators had been cut off <span class="locked">for&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, the two regular elevators had, but what about the service
elevator that had two doors, one leading into the basement and another one
leading on the other side of the basement? Are you familiar with the elevator
at all?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir; it has a back door to it leading out into the alley,
and that is the elevator I believe, that was brought down and cut off and an
officer stationed there to see that it didn't run.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you aware of any planned route from the basement area
to the county jail?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. My instructions were that I would escort the armored
car, which would be a decoy, from Commerce Street ramp to Central northbound.
To Elm Street onto Houston Street, which would be the entrance to
the county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did you receive those orders from?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. From Chief Curry and Chief Stevenson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time did you get those orders?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I would assume it was about 11:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I immediately left. I received these instructions in the
homicide office, which is on the third floor of the city hall. Immediately left
there and rode the elevator down to the basement where I secured a car and
I found that the normal exit, which is the exit on Commerce Street from the
basement of the city hall, was blocked by an armored car. It was necessary
for me to use the Main Street exit. I mean&mdash;actually, the Main Street entrance,
because we don't <span class="locked">exit&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you used it as an exit?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I used it as an exit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was with you?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Sergeant Putnam was in the front seat with me and
Sergeant Maxey was in the back seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, tell us what happened along the route then?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Well, we pulled out of the basement, and I would judge
from the time, from the length of time, probably a length it would take it
to circle city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you got to the top of the basement, were there any guards
there on the Main Street entrance?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Patrolman Vaughn was stationed at the top of the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You knew him prior to that time?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened then?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Well, actually, nothing happened outside of the fact that
he had to move out of the way to let us out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which way did he move?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. He moved toward the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean on which side of you?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. He moved to my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And towards the street?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. And towards the street; yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What way was he facing then during the period that you were
moving by him?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. He was facing me, as well as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Momentarily, anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In fact, he would have been looking from where he was standing
toward the Main Street entrance?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him turn his head any at all?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No, sir; I couldn't see him for just a matter of a second
there when I pulled out. That ramp is steep and a little bit difficult to get out
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he step out in the street at all?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you turn, immediately outside the Main Street entry
or exit, to your right?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I was aware that people were pressed, not a large number
of them, but I would say maybe four or five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On your right?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No, well, probably might have been a&mdash;I don't know. Just
a guess. I don't recall the number of people now, what it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall whether there were some people on your right?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I was aware that people were on both sides of the car
when I pulled across the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how far from the entrance?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Well, probably 6 or 7 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize anybody at all?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Nobody except one by the name of Vaughn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, subsequently, of course, it turned out that Ruby shot
Oswald. Did you know him prior to that time?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ruby?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir; I have known him 12 or 13 years, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you would recognize him without any difficulty whether
he had a hat on or not?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I don't think I would have any trouble recognizing him if
I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not, see him in that crowd to your right?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No; I didn't see him that day at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think that if he had been there he would have recognized
you?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I'm saying the possibilities are very great that had he
been there I might not have seen him. I mean, due to the time element and
more or less concerned with getting across the sidewalk and into the street,
driving the automobile at the same time. I am saying the possibilities are very
good that I might not have seen him had he been there. I'd be very hesitant
to say that I wouldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I'm going to mark for identification three documents. First,
I am marking, "Dallas, Texas, March 24th, 1964, Exhibit 5077. Deposition of
Rio Pierce" and putting my name underneath that, and my initial on the
second page and in the right-hand lower corner, that being a copy of a letter
dated November 26, 1963, addressed to Chief Curry. The second document also
consisting of two pages, a report of an interview with you by FBI Agents Smith
and Chapoton, on December 6, in 1963. I am marking that, "Dallas, Texas,
March 24, 1964. Exhibit 5078, deposition of Rio Pierce." Signing my name on
the front page of that, and I place my initials on the lower right-hand corner
of the second page. And I am marking a third document on the right-hand
margin, "Dallas, Texas, March 24, 1964. Exhibit 5079, deposition of Rio Pierce."
Signing my name on that front page and placing my initials in the lower
right-hand corner of the second and third pages. That last document, to wit:
5079, purports to be a report of an interview by FBI Agents Chapoton and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
Smith of you, Rio Pierce, on December 2, 1963. Now, I ask you if you have
had an opportunity to look at these documents?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are those documents correct and true?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. To the best of my knowledge, they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are there any omissions of a material nature?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I don't recall any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anything you would like to delete as not being the truth, or add
because it has been omitted?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No; I don't see anything in there that I would care to
change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As far as you know, this represents the truth as you know it?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Maxey was in your car, was he not?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he in the rear?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever talk to you about having seen Daniels at the exit?
N.&nbsp;J. Daniels?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. You mean since then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, since the day you drove out of there. In other words,
have you and Maxey ever, at all, conversed about whether he, Maxey, saw
Daniels?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. It is possible. I don't recall. People talk about a lot
of things since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, there has been no interview between you and any member
of the Commission's staff before this deposition today, has there?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anything else you want to say or add or change?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Pierce</span>. I don't know of a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<h2 id="JAP">TESTIMONY OF SGT. JAMES A. PUTNAM</h2>

<p>The testimony of Sgt. James A. Putnam was taken at 10:05 p.m., on March 24,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. This is the deposition of Sgt. James A. Putnam,
Dallas Police Department. Sergeant Putnam, my name is Leon Hubert, Jr., I
am a member of the advisory staff of the general counsel on the President's
Commission. Under the provisions of the Executive Order 11130, dated November
29, 1963, by President of the United States, the joint resolution of
Congress No. 137 and the rules of procedure adopted by the President's Commission
in conformance with the Executive order and the joint resolution, I have
been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you, Mr. Putnam. I state to
you now that the general nature of the Commission's inquiry is to ascertain,
evaluate, and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In particular
to you, Sergeant Putnam, the nature of this inquiry tonight is to determine what
facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts you
know, now, about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Sergeant Putnam, you have appeared by virtue of a general request made to
Chief Curry by the general counsel of the staff of the President's Commission,
Mr. J. Lee Rankin. Under the rules adopted by the Commission you are entitled
to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of this deposition, but the
rules also provide that a witness may waive the 3-day written notice. Now, I'll
ask you if you are willing to waive that 3-day written notice?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. What is the purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Simply this, that any witness&mdash;the Commission says that any
witness should have a privilege of having 3 days' written notice before he may
be called upon to testify, and that in writing. Now, you have not had that,
because of the way the request came. You see, the request came by letter to
Mr. Curry from Mr. Rankin, who is the general counsel of the President's Commission, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. May I ask why it was done by this method rather than
the normal official notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Simply because of the number of people that were involved. If
you wish to have the normal 3-day <span class="locked">notice&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Well, will any further&mdash;will there be necessary for me
to appear at any further date? Also, are we going to conclude it tonight? I
will waive it for tonight and request if there is a further need for me to arrive
at this time, that I receive it if&mdash;it has got my only day off in 2 weeks. I will
waive it at this time and request it if you do need me again, but I do get the
3-day official notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We certainly will do so. First, let me say this in regard to the
time and so forth and being your day off. The actual sequence of witnesses
and the times they appear was not arranged by us. I don't want to place the
blame on anyone but I am awfully sorry.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. That's all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me say that if we want to call you in again, you will surely
get the notice, but I don't believe you will be. However, I can't be absolutely
certain. I will get in touch with you by phone and be sure that we don't disturb
any of your rest days, because I know how important that is. Would you stand
up and raise your right hand and take the oath. Do you solemnly swear to
tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Please state your full name, please.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. James A. Putnam.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your age?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Thirty-seven.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your residence?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. 2015 Joan Drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Dallas?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your present occupation and how long have you held
it?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Police officer. Ten years and four months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the rank you have now?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been sergeant? You have held that for how
long?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Eight months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have the same rank and responsibilities during the
period of November 22 and 24?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who do you serve under, sir?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Lieutenant Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Lieutenant Pierce is with the patrol division?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He is under Captain Talbert?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, then, Captain Talbert is your superior officer, <span class="locked">too&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the line of command. Now, I have in my hand, two documents
which I am going to mark&mdash;three documents which I am going to mark.
Marking the first one as follows, to wit: "Dallas, Texas, March 24, 1964, Exhibit
5071. Deposition of J.&nbsp;A. Putnam," and I am signing my name on that.
The document is supposed to be a copy of a letter dated November 26, addressed
by James A. Putnam to Chief of Police J.&nbsp;E. Curry, and it has two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
pages. I am placing my initials on the second page. I am marking another
document as follows, "Dallas, Texas, March 24th, 1964, Exhibit 5072. Deposition
of J.&nbsp;A. Putnam." I am signing my name on that page, the exhibit being
a single page exhibit. Then I am marking a four-page exhibit being a report
of an interview of you made on December the 3, by Special Agents Carris and
Peden of the FBI. I am marking the first page in the bottom right hand,
"Dallas, Texas, March 24, 1964, Exhibit 5073. Deposition of J.&nbsp;A. Putnam."
I am signing my name on the first page below that, and putting my initials in
the lower right-hand corner of the three subsequent pages on that exhibit.
Have you had a chance to read these three documents that I have marked?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I thought there were two. I would like to see the second
one you marked. It may be another interview by the FBI. Now, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I wasn't aware that this was separate. I know I read
the first one. Yes; I had missed that page. That <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I want to ask you about all three of them, as a group, if
we can handle them that way, and if we <span class="locked">can't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I believe we can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If they represent the truth, if there are any errors in any of
those exhibits, if there are any omissions, do you wish to add anything, delete
anything or modify anything?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir; I accept them as they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, would you do this, then. Would you put your name
below my name where it appears and your initials below my initials that appear.
Now, sergeant, I have only a very few questions, I think, to ask you
about this, because as I read your statements they are rather complete, taking
the three together. They just give about everything you know about the whole
thing.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand from this, you were in the basement area, from
about 9:30 until shortly before 11:20?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You assisted, I think, in the searches made of the basement
area?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You made some of these searches yourself?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, I&mdash;now, <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you know him now, of course. Did you on November 24,
prior to the time that Oswald was shot, did you know of the existence of a person
named Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I had heard the name. But so far as ever meeting him
personally, I don't think that I ever had. If I did, I don't remember it from
seeing his pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what I wanted to ask you, on the 24th, if you had met
him and had formed a sufficient impression upon your mind so that you would
have recognized him at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, you did see his picture and perhaps you saw him after
his arrest?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I saw his picture. I have not seen him personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't see him in the basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of anyone who did?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. That saw him in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Prior to the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you been in any discussion with anybody as to who might
have seen him and who might not have?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir. I&mdash;there have been discussions to the effect that
if he were there, surely someone would have seen him and recognized him.
I mean, just in informal discussions, how could he be there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And yet, of course, he was there?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I understand that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you know of no evidence that would indicate that anyone
did actually see him?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have never heard anyone say that he had seen him?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you heard anyone say that they knew that someone had
seen him there?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the discussions have been simply that since
he was there it is just amazing that he was not seen my anybody?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Except when I evaluate it. Having worked with those
reporters and around them I can understand how that could have happened,
because with as many a number of reporters that we dealt with for those
2 days, it's a tough job knowing everyone personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you were directed to get into a car with a couple of
people and drive around to the Commerce Street side?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who gave you that direction?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Sergeant Dean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you drove out you were driving the car, weren't you?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. That's&mdash;no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Weren't you? Didn't you drive the car?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who drove it?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Lieutenant Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, I'm sorry. Did you see Lieutenant Pierce leave with the
car?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I was in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you seated in the car?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. In the front seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I'm sorry. The front right seat?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was in the back seat?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Sergeant Maxey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first get seated in the car?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Are you referring to time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let's get it this way, I understand that you had to get out of
the car to move some of the people out of the way so that the car could go
up the ramp.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you were seated in the car in the basement or parking
area at first when you started off?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Actually on the ramp that comes from the parking area
to the ramp that goes between the two streets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Got in the car there?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have to get out?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you have to get out?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. After he traveled about 10 to 15 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why did you have to get out?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Because the reporters had formed on the north.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Main Street?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. On the north.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why don't you just use the street directions. Main Street
ramp?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Main Street ramp, but by the "ramp" I don't mean the
incline, where it flattens out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand. On that flat part.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. That's right. So, I had to get out of the car and move
them back to prevent hitting some of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many people were in that area do you think?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I would estimate 15 to 25.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And they were standing shoulder to shoulder?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I didn't get&mdash;this impression. They were standing in
wait of the expected departure of Oswald, and they were just mingled, and
you know how reporters act and operate in trying to position themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It wasn't enough that you were able to blow the horn, you
had to get out?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. We didn't even attempt to blow the horn to cause confusion.
First of all, this is the entrance and not the exit. They are not
expecting a vehicle coming out of there, they are not paying attention to us.
They are looking in the direction they expect Oswald to come out from, so,
I got out <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When the path cleared up, you got back in again?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the window on the right down?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. The window was down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you got to the top of the ramp, what happened?
That is when you got to the Main Street, the sidewalk area, and, of course,
the street area, would you describe in your own words just what happened?
What did you see?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I saw officer Vaughn and about six persons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was Vaughn now when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. In front of our automobile about the middle of the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he do?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. He stepped to the right and about to the curb, or just off
of the curb, glanced to his right and looked back and waved us on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went into Main Street and turned left?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he go very much out into the street to assist you to get out?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say he stepped off of the curb, though?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Possibly one step off of the curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then he looked to his right and his left? How did he do
that?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was he standing? With his back to you?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. My impression was he was facing us and my impression
was that he glanced to his right, which would be to the westbound traffic and
Lieutenant Pierce, the driver, was on the left and in a position to see the eastbound
traffic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, turned his head so that the back of his head
would have been towards the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he stepped off of the curb just about 2 feet?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Well, I would say in one step, 2 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn't go into the middle of the street?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he waved you on?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. He immediately turned back and glanced like this [indicating],
and turned back, and was walking back to his position on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say from the time you all reached the Main Street
exit point to the time that Vaughn started to walk back to his position, it
took only a matter of 3 or 4 seconds?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. We didn't even stop the car. It would be very few
seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No stop at all?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Just a&mdash;to prevent from hitting a pedestrian walking
on the sidewalk. Now, there wasn't one walking, but to take a quick glance
like you would do approaching a sidewalk, the car was slowed, and immediately&mdash;at
this time everything happened at once. He slowed the car, Vaughn
walked and glanced and waved us on. He accelerated and we went on to
Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you turn your head to the right when you got to the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see anybody?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was not a soul?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Didn't see anyone in sight in&mdash;except Officer Vaughn
and the persons that I say were on the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, there was nobody coming up Main Street
towards Harwood?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I can't say that there was not. I can say that I didn't
see them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is all you can do, of course.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And there was no one standing there that you saw?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Specifically, now, the man that you later knew to be Jack Ruby,
you did not see either walking up, or standing by on the Pearl Street side of
Main Street exit?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you look at the people on the left side?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I only glanced. I <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you identify anybody?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Not a person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you specifically say that Ruby was not there?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All you can say is, I take it then, the man you have since learned
to be Ruby was&mdash;you didn't see him?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If he was there, you didn't see him?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I didn't see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you go as far as to say, turning again to your right-hand
side, that there was nobody on your right-hand side at all?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. I can say that there was no one in the immediate vicinity
within, I would say&mdash;well, it was apparent that&mdash;15 feet away from me I saw
a group of people standing, and to the <span class="locked">right&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. To the left, and to the right I saw no one in the immediate
vicinity of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is immediately upon coming out?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see the person who has subsequently been identified
as Jack Ruby among the reporters that he pushed through?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see any such person come down the ramp as you were
going up the ramp?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far down Main Street to Pearl do you think you can see?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Well, it is a clear view to Pearl Street, but my attention
would not have been directed by someone half a block away. It would have
made no impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, your thought is that there was nobody at least as far as
a half a block away?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. That's my belief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Vaughn turned immediately back and went back to his
position?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. Was walking back in that direction. In other words, we
could have been close enough to touch him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As you passed, he was walking back.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And therefore, he was facing towards the entrance?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear him call to anybody up there?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, is there anything else you would like to say?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any other facts that aren't covered in the documents which
we have identified here as 5071, 5072 and 5073?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I do not believe you have been interviewed by any member of
the Commission's staff at all prior to this deposition?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Putnam</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, I think that is all. If any fact that has not been
developed in these reports and in your testimony should come to your attention,
I hope you will free to let us know about it if you think it is a material
fact. All we are seeking is to get the facts. That's all. And if, by chance,
you have forgotten something and you should remember it at a later date, please
contact us through the United States attorney's office and tell them that you have
a fact that you would like to report that you have overlooked and we will make
arrangements to see you again.</p>

<p>But at this time, we will give you the 3 days' notice.</p>

<p>I thank you, sir.</p>

<h2 id="WBS">TESTIMONY OF WILLIE B. SLACK</h2>

<p>The testimony of Willie B. Slack was taken at 11 a.m., on March 31, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Patrolman Willie&mdash;is that Willie? Not
William?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Willie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Willie B. Slack. Mr. Slack, my name is Leon Hubert. I am
a member of the advisory staff of the general counsel of the President's
Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. Under the rules
provided by the Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and the joint
resolution of Congress, No. 137, together with the rules of procedure adopted
by the President's Commission in conformance with the Executive order and
joint resolution, I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you,
Mr. Slack.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission's inquiry is
to ascertain, evaluate and report upon the facts relating to the assassination
of President Kennedy, and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.
In particular to you, Mr. Slack, the nature of the inquiry today is to determine
the facts that you know about the death of Oswald, and any other pertinent
facts you may know about the general inquiry. Now, Mr. Slack, you have
appeared here today by virtue of the general request made to Chief Curry by
J. Lee Rankin, who is general counsel of the President's Commission. Under the
rules adopted by this Commission, you are entitled to a 3-day written notice that
your deposition is going to be taken, but the rules also provide that you may waive
the 3-day written notice if you see fit to do so. And are you now willing to
waive that 3-day notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. I do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That being the case, will you stand and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear then to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. W.&nbsp;B. Slack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Thirty-nine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. 5605 Sumatra, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Patrolman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been a patrolman on the Dallas Police
Force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Ten years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your particular assignment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Working in the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What duties do you have there, in general?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. We answer the telephone, and when the officers bring the worksheets
down, we book them on a booking form.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, book the prisoners in and out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Check them out when somebody comes in and pays them out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say, "Pays them out," you mean, makes bond?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir; or writs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or writs? Oh, you mean if they are released on a writ?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, your office then is the control center, as it
were, for people coming in and people coming out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You work in shifts, of course, like all the rest of the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on duty on November 24, 1963, the day that Oswald
was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you come on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. 6:30 a.m., in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had what is called the first platoon, I think. Eleven o'clock,
oh, no&mdash;I beg your pardon. That would be the second platoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Second platoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Comes on at 6:30 and goes off at 2:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. 2:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, you were there between 11 and the time Oswald was
shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen him before that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Not to my knowledge; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall the occasion when Oswald was brought down
to be transferred to the county jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, tell us what you know about it in your own words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Well, he got off the elevator <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen him before that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir; and he was flanked on either side by detectives and
Captain Fritz was with the detectives, and they went out the swinging doors,
which is into the basement of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what time that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. 11:20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you fix that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. When a prisoner is released from jail we have to put the time
on a booking card, we have to put them down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does that booking card exist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you examined it briefly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. I examined it before I came to work, before I came over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When? This morning, or yesterday, <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. That was yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What does it show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. It <span class="locked">shows&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Transferred to the county at 11:20 a.m., on the 24th of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whose handwriting is that entry in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. It is in mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, how did you fix the time? How do you normally fix the
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Well, we put the date and the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I mean is, do you have an electric clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir; do it with a pencil, or fountain pen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you rely upon your watch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir; we have a clock on the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that an electric clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it accurate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. That, I can't answer, <span class="locked">because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I mean, you all go by it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Time is of importance in going in and going out of prisoners,
isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir; it sure is important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if the clock is checked at any time to see if it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Not to my knowledge; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever observed it to be wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir; I sure haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, it certainly needs checking procedure to see if it loses
time, or gains, or stops because of the electricity being cut off, or something of
that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes. Well, if the time was different from one of our watches I
imagine they would call "Time," sir. Of course, we call "Time," all the time
usually checking the news, you know, so it is checked that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In your opinion, that clock is accurate; right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If it were in error, what would you say would be the greatest
error it could be in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Well, it couldn't be over a minute or two either way, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, what happened after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Well, he went out the door, and then my job there was to, when
the lieutenant told me that they had got in the car or transportation which was
to be used, they then would notify me, and I was supposed to notify the dispatcher
that they <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were you supposed to notify the dispatcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. That they were on their way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you received any orders about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean, who told you that, to notify the dispatcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Lieutenant Wiggins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, notifying the dispatcher, would mean that it would go over
the radio?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir; they have a direct line to the county.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, the purpose of notifying the dispatcher, so far as you know,
was for them to telephone the county that the prisoner was on his way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Apparently; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been told that by Wiggins or had you been told that&mdash;merely
to notify the dispatcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. <span class="locked">The&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We have to take it on the record. <span class="locked">Just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Well, my letter there I wrote that&mdash;do you have a copy of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. That I&mdash;well, I can say that I was told to tell the dispatcher that
he was en route to the county.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who the dispatcher was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Jim Farr is the dispatcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I mean on that particular day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Well, he is, like I say, the dispatcher up there, but when I called
on this particular occasion, I got Miss Cason first, and then <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, that was to report to Miss Cason that the man had
been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir; <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you say to Miss Cason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Told her that Oswald had been shot, and that we needed a doctor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you call for an ambulance, tell her you needed an ambulance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your remark to Miss Cason was simply that Oswald had been
shot and to get a doctor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir; best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when did you write out the entry which you say was in
your own hand showing that the prisoner was being transferred at 11:20? Was
that done at 11:20 or later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. I would&mdash;I believe I wrote it out then. In other words, what I
am in the habit of doing is this. That is something that comes naturally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the normal procedure is that the time of release
and the time of action <span class="locked">taken&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. I was standing <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me finish my question; is done simultaneously with the act
itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that normally, when a prisoner leaves you make these notations,
and you look to see what time it is. You enter the time, and that is how
the notation is made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As far as you know, was there any deviation from that normal
procedure in the case of the transfer of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. The deviation, it was in this point, that we usually have it filled
out before the prisoner is brought down. In this particular case, we didn't
know when he was going to be transferred, so therefore, we had to write down
when he did come down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you hadn't pulled his card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. I had his card pulled. I knew he was going to be transferred,
presumably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you didn't know the time; so, therefore, you hadn't entered
anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir; I had it on the clipboard on the counter where we always
keep them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your best recollection about what you entered there
with reference to the shooting, that is to say, was the entry made before or
after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. It was made before the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, it was made in the interval when he came out
of the elevator and they walked out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. [Witness nods head.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She can't&mdash;you have to say something, because the reporter
can't record silence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir; I forget.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't see the shooting, as I understand it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir; I saw the shuffle out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then they brought Ruby and Oswald in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did either Ruby or Oswald say anything that you, yourself
heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice the time that they brought them in? Who came
in first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. I don't know, sir. Like I say, the lieutenant told me to call the
doctor, and, of course, my back end was turned a few seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say, "lieutenant," I believe you are referring to
Lieutenant Wiggins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Wiggins; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you called the dispatcher and told him what you said you
told him, and what happened next, to your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Well, it was just about over with then except the ambulance did
come in, and, of course, that was a little confusion around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anything about the times of, say the movement
of Ruby up in the elevator to the jail, or the time when the ambulance arrived
and the time when it left with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir; not the exact time; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No record was made on any of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Not that I know of. Not in our office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the form called that you filled in with your own hand
about the time of movement? Does that have a number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. We call it a booking card.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Booking card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think you testified that yesterday you looked at it to
refresh your memory and it is in your handwriting, and it states 11:20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Apparently sometime ago, let's say on December 12, you were
interviewed by the FBI, and at that time you stated it was between 11:25 and
11:30 that Oswald was brought down. Can you assist us in explaining this
discrepancy between the two times? Do you remember that interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir; I remember the interview; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Edmond Hardin and Paul Scott, and yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall telling them it was 11:25?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any recollection now about it, or are you relying
upon what you saw on the records yesterday when you looked at it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. That would be the way I would have to go on it, sir, would be
the records there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are satisfied that the record which is normally made extemporaneously
with the act is really more accurate than your present memory
right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or would have been more accurate actually than your statement
to the FBI agent if, in fact, you did say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like you to just read these two documents. The one,
the FBI report, and the other, the letter. Have you had occasion to read the
two documents I have handed you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me mark them then for identification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. There is a little <span class="locked">discrepancy&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; I'm going to give you an opportunity to explain them.</p>

<p>For the purpose of identification I am marking what purports to be a copy of
a letter addressed to Mr. J.&nbsp;E. Curry, chief of police, apparently signed by Willie
B. Slack, dated November 27, 1963. I am marking it "Dallas, Texas, March 31.
1963, Exhibit No. 5116, deposition of W.&nbsp;B. Slack." Putting my name below it.
It has only one page. For the purpose of identification, I am marking what
purports to be an FBI interview of Willie B. Slack by Agents Hardin and Scott,
which took place on December 2, 1963. I am marking the first page of that
document with the following, "Dallas, Texas, March 31, 1964. Exhibit No. 5117.
Deposition of W.&nbsp;B. Slack," and signing my name, and on the second page
thereof, on the lower right-hand corner I am placing my initial. Now, Patrolman
Slack, I show you the document marked Exhibit 5116, and ask you if you have
read it, and if it is a correct statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a correct statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that the record may show that we are both talking about the
same thing, same document, I wonder if you will just put your name below mine.
Now, we will refer to a document&mdash;in two pages&mdash;that I have marked a moment
ago for identification as "5117," and ask you if you have read that, and if that
is correct, or if you have any corrections or observation or comments to make
with reference to that document? For the purpose of identification will you
mark these two documents with your name where my name is, and with your
initials where my initials are, and then you can make the comments if you
want to correct it or modify it and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. You want me to mark it before <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just sign your name on that, and on the second page write your
initials. That's right. Now, have you any comments to make, or any corrections
to make concerning that document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Well, on your second page, in here, the document here stated that
Patrolman Slack cleared his office. I didn't have anything to do with security in
the office. Only part I was in charge would be the immediate area in which I
was standing, and nobody was in there, of course, but our personnel. Of course,
I believe I did make the statement to them after they had cleared it, it wasn't
no one that had come in except authorized personnel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you are speaking of the second to last paragraph on the
second page and you want to modify that paragraph so that it will conform
with the statement you have just made, and which the stenographer has
recorded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir; I am not a supervisor or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice also, and I believe you have already testified about this,
but I think for the purposes of clarity, we ought to note it, and that is that
upon the first page there is a statement that about 11:25 to 11:30, Oswald was
brought down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your previous testimony actually has clarified that, but it was
those times that you were speaking about in this deposition earlier, that is to
say, that as to this statement in "5117" the last paragraph on the first page,
wherein it says that you saw Oswald coming down somewhere between 11:25
and 11:30, your previous statement or testimony is more accurate, that is to
say, that it was about 11:20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think that modification ought to be noted, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. Yes; I do too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it is noted, because the reporter has taken it down. Now,
have you any other statement that you would like to make that has not been
covered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir; that is about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you interviewed by me or any other member of the Commission's
staff prior to the taking of this deposition?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir; except <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The FBI? Yes. I mean the President's Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The staff of the President's Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slack</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir; I think that is all. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="DFS">TESTIMONY OF DON FRANCIS STEELE</h2>

<p>The testimony of Don Francis Steele was taken at 10:05 p.m., on March 25,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. My name is Leon D. Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff
of the General Counsel on the President's Commission. Under the provisions
of the Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and joint resolution
of Congress No. 137 and the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in
conformance with that Executive order in the joint resolution I have been
authorized to take the sworn deposition from you, Mr. Steele. I now state that
the general nature of the Commission's inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and
report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and
the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In particular to you, Mr.
Steele, the nature of our inquiry tonight is to determine the facts you know
about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts you may know about
the general inquiry. Mr. Steele, you have appeared here by virtue of a request
made by the general counsel on the staff of the President's Commission, Mr.
J. Lee Rankin, directed to Chief J.&nbsp;E. Curry. Under the rules adopted by the
Commission, you are entitled to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of
this deposition, but the rules adopted by this Commission also provide that you
may waive that 3-day notice if you are willing to do so. Now, the question is:
Are you willing to waive the notice?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you stand and raise your right hand and be sworn. Do you
solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your full name?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Don Francis Steele.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Thirty-two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. 1707 Kent Drive, Arlington, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your occupation?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Sergeant of police, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been a sergeant of police?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Five years and four months&mdash;five months, excuse me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What division or department of the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. I am presently in the patrol division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you on November 22, 23, and 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. November 22 I was on a day off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 23d?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. 23d I worked in the Oak Cliff area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. And the 24th, of course, the regular assignment is in the
Oak Cliff area, and I reported to that assignment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you moved from that assignment?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. I came to the city hall, came to the police station downtown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
early that morning to pick up some correspondence, telegrams, and things like
that, to take to Officer Tippit's widow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what time was that?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. That was approximately 9:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened after that?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Well, the captain was bringing in some of the patrolmen
from in the field, from all the stations, and I asked Lieutenant Pierce if there was
anything he needed me to do before I left, and he said, "Well&mdash;" told me I'd
better stick around for a while. He might need me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do anything later on?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Well, I stayed there and in the patrol office for 15 or 20
minutes, and then the captain came <span class="locked">in&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which captain?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Captain Talbert, C.&nbsp;E. Talbert. He told me to come on and
go with him, and he wanted to look the situation over outside. We walked
down the stairs to the first floor where the corporation court is located and out
the door on the Commerce Street&mdash;and there were several&mdash;they blocked those
buildings directly across the street from the police building. He told me to get
a man, or get as many people as I needed and check the buildings over there to
make sure that there weren't any doors open, or somebody wasn't concealed
inside the building. I got a patrolman, I believe it was Officer Jez. We went
over there, checked all the doors in the front. They were all secure. We climbed
up the fire escape and checked the roofs of all of the buildings directly across
from the vehicular exit on the Commerce Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When that was completed, what did you do?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Not much of anything for a while. Stayed down there in
the basement for I guess 30 or 40 minutes and everything was kind of at a
standstill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was that?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. About the time I finished checking the buildings, and everything,
I guess it was&mdash;now, wait a minute. Excuse me. Then I reported&mdash;after
I checked those buildings, I reported to Captain Talbert that there was a
large crowd of pedestrians on the sidewalk right outside of the vehicular route,
and he&mdash;told me to get some men, some reserve officers if I could, and move
them across the street onto the south side of Commerce Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do that?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Yes, I got five reserve officers and took them out there and
told them what I wanted them to do. Helped them do it. Moved all the
pedestrians across over to the south side of the street, and I stationed two of
them at the corner of Harwood and Commerce, the northeast corner, with
instructions to restrict any pedestrian traffic. In other words, not to allow them
to come back to that vehicular exit, and I put two more down at Pearl and
Commerce Street, and one at the door to city hall with the same instructions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the <span class="locked">Commerce&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. The municipal building. The nearest door to the municipal
building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you place any on the Main Street door to the municipal
building?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. No, sir; I never got to the Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you place any officers to direct traffic at the intersection of
Main and Pearl, or to control traffic?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Well, we started&mdash;can I go on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; surely.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Well, we'll get to that. After I got these reserve people put
out, as I say, I got down&mdash;went down in the basement and talked to the captain
for a few minutes. And I stood around and things were kind of at a standstill
there. There was lots of television and camera people in there, and about 10:30,
I guess, the captain told Sergeant Dean, who related to myself and Sergeant
Putnam that they would bring this armored car in and the armored car was
going to go down Main Street to the county jail, and he said to get all the regular
patrol officers, all the regular officers and assign them to traffic intersections,
traffic corners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On what street?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. On Main Street, and I just helped Sergeant Dean make the
assignments. I don't recall whether I specifically assigned a man to Main and
Pearl, but then the captain came along a few minutes later and said it had been
changed, that we were going to run the armored car down Elm Street, so,
whatever men we may have assigned to Main and Pearl, that is where he would
have been, and he was taken off the assignment. They never went to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Okay. So, as far as you know there were no police officers of
any sort, reserve or regular directing traffic or controlling it in any way on the
corner of Main and Pearl?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. To the best of my knowledge, there was no regular officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about a reserve officer?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. I couldn't say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, the original plan to assign one to Pearl and Main,
wasn't carried out because of the change in plans, and that man, whoever he was,
went to Pearl and Elm?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Yes. I think that it was&mdash;let's see. I believe it was one
of my men from Oak Cliff, but I'm not sure, but he never did get to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. We didn't even leave the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you when the shot was fired?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. I was at the county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean in the basement?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. No; I had left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, you had left, so, you weren't in this building at all?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. I left about 15 minutes before it occurred. See, we didn't
have enough officers, enough radio patrolmen to fill all the corners to put a man
at each intersection on Elm Street, so, I went to the county to contact the traffic
people and see if I could get three men from them, that is how many we needed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Ralph Paul that lives in
Arlington?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you familiar with a place called "The Bull Pen" there?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is "The Bull Pen"?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. It is a barbecue place, sell beer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the manager of it?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. No, no; I can't recall being in that place more than once or
twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the name Ralph Paul doesn't mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Ruby?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How well do you know him?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Through contacts, various contacts when I was a patrolman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had you known him?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Well, I had actually first met him, or heard of, or saw
Jack Ruby, I guess, in 1955, about 8 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you recognize him by sight, do you think, if you saw him?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Yes; I feel like I would, although, it has been several
years since I have seen him in person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have occasion to observe the number of people who were
standing in the Main Street ramp part of the basement just at the entrance of
the jail corridor? Do you know what I mean? In other words, as you were
standing in the basement looking toward Main Street where the jail corridor
intersects the <span class="locked">ramp&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Right at the <span class="locked">corner&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right at the corner, and looking toward Main Street, did you
have occasion to observe how many people were in that area just shortly before
the shooting?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Well, 15 minutes would be as close as I could go, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
that time only probably 10 or 12, kind of milling around. Reporters, television
people walking back and forth and that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You left the building about 11?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Approximately 11; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what kind of car Jack Ruby drives?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. No. Years ago seems to me like he had a Buick, but that
was years ago when I was a patrolman and it has been over 5 years. I think
he had a Buick at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have not been interviewed by me or any member of
the Commission's staff prior to this deposition tonight, have you, sir?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Have you anything else you wish to add?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. I guess I ought to mention this officer who was with me
during all of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. J.&nbsp;F. Harrison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By the way, I meant to ask you, you have read those statements?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I'll mark the one dated November 25, 1963, addressed to Chief
of Police Curry, apparently the original was signed by you, by placing on that
document, "Dallas, Texas, March 25th, 1964. Exhibit 5098. Deposition of
D.&nbsp;F. Steele," and mark my name below it, and I have marked another document
which purports to be an interview by FBI Agents Robertson and Scott of you
on December 3, 1963, by marking the first page, "Dallas, Texas, March 25th, 1964,
Exhibit 5097, deposition of D.&nbsp;F. Steele." And I sign my name. On the second
page of the document I have placed my initials on the bottom of the right-hand
corner of the page. I would like to ask you if you have read those, and if those
statements are correct?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. I have read them. The only thing that I would say, in
paragraph&mdash;this would be No. 6. Let's see. One, two, three, four, five, be paragraph
No. 6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of Exhibit <span class="locked">50&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. 5097.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. It mentions that I assisted Sergeant Dean in redistributing
the newsmen and TV men in the basement area, but actually, I didn't do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than that correction, are those two exhibits correct, so
far as you know?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Can I clarify one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, yes; certainly.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. On page 2, of that <span class="locked">same&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 5097?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Yes, sir; paragraph No. 7, says that I did not have knowledge
of security measures in effect in the police building. I had knowledge
that there was some type of pass required, but this was my first contact with
it, and it was being handled by the other sergeant, so, consequently, I didn't
know too much about what was required to enter the basement, but I knew
that the men on the checkpoint did know what they were supposed to be
checking for. And the next paragraph says I had not seen Ruby in approximately
2 years. I'd say probably more like 3 years when I was a jail sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any other corrections or additions you wish to make?</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, so that the record may show that we are talking about
the same document would you put your name below mine where it appears
and your initials below mine where they appear on the second page. Your
name there.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Just sign my name right here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's right; and just put your initials on the bottom.</p>

<p>Sergeant <span class="smcap">Steele</span>. Down here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; and then the other single documents just sign your name
below mine. All right, sir. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="REV">TESTIMONY OF ROY EUGENE VAUGHN</h2>

<p>The testimony of Roy Eugene Vaughn was taken at 9:10 a.m., on April 17,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of
the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Vaughn, my name is Leon Hubert. I'm a member of the
advisory staff of the general counsel of the President's Commission. Under
the provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and the
joint resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by
the Commission in conformance with the Executive order and joint resolution,
I have been authorized to take a sworn statement from you.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission's inquiry is
to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon facts relating to the assassination of
President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular to you, Mr. Vaughn, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other
pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry, and more particularly
about the entry or possible entry of Ruby into the basement through the Main
Street ramp. Did you get a letter directed to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. To appear here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That letter was a written request, written by Mr. J. Lee Rankin,
General Counsel of the Commission, to you asking you to appear; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that letter received by you more than 3 days from this day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you rise and take the oath?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Roy Eugene Vaughn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old are you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I am 29.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. 3231 Loganwood Drive, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been on the police force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Almost 6 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What rank or rating do you hold now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Patrolman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were on duty at the police department on Sunday, November
24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you report for duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I'd say at approximately 9 a.m. we got a call to call the patrol
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean your normal station was not at headquarters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Oh, no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was your normal station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. At this particular month, being the month we worked days, and
I work relief&mdash;I don't work any certain district&mdash;and I work just more or less
wherever I am needed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, they let you know at your home in some way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; I had already reported for work. I was working with
squad 105 that particular morning, which is in the downtown area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's a patrol car?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes&mdash;district 105, and approximately at 9 a.m. I got a call to call
511, which is patrol headquarters. Officer L.&nbsp;C. Taylor, who answered the phone,
advised me to report to the city hall and park my car and report to 511.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is 511?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Which would be the patrol office&mdash;that's the extension number
which is commonly referred to as such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have a partner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time did you report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I would say approximately 9:15, Mr. Hubert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when you got there what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I walked in the&mdash;there was a little small assembly room off of
the main office, and I walked in there&mdash;there was several men, officers in
there&mdash;there was Officer Patterson, Officer Brock, and I think R.&nbsp;C. Nelson,
I believe, came in a little later, and they had the coffee pot on and so we, I think
most of us got a cup of coffee and was just sitting there talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Then Lieutenant Pierce walked in and told me and Officer
Nelson and Officer Brock and Officer Patterson to report to Sergeant Dean in the
basement, and he told me to tell Sergeant Dean when this was secured, when
the basement was secured, to leave two men in the basement and secure the
others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To leave two men in the basement and to what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, he said after this was all completed, this transferring was
completed, to leave two men&mdash;that means to leave two men in the basement
area and to secure the other two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And to secure the other two what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Two men&mdash;you see, there were four of us that went down and
he said to leave two in the basement and to secure the other two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What does that mean, "secure the other two?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, that means just turn them loose and send them back to
their regular duties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, of the four men, you were to help in whatever
Dean was doing, and then he told you, "Tell Dean&mdash;leave two men in the basement
and turn the other two loose?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes; that's after everything was completed. That's his message
that he more or less sent by me to Sergeant Dean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, does that term "secure" mean to turn the men loose&mdash;does
that mean they would go off duty or that they were to report back somewhere
else to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. They were to report back for somewhere else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you follow those instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any part in the checkout of the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. As far as actually checking the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, I was assigned by Sergeant Putnam, who was with
Sergeant Dean in the basement, when we got down there&mdash;Sergeant Putnam
assigned me to the Main Street ramp and I believe he assigned also Patrolman
Patterson to the Commerce Street ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, about what time did he assign you to the Main Street
entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I would say, Mr. Hubert, somewhere around 9:30&mdash;I couldn't
be definite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give you any instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes; he said not to let anybody enter the basement except police
and the press, and only the press when they had an official press card, and
if I didn't recognize any officer by sight to require identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you understand by that that he meant that even if an officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
was in what purported to be a uniform, that you weren't to let him in anyhow
unless he had an identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, he said&mdash;the way I understand it, Mr. Hubert, if I recognized
them by sight and knew them to be an officer, and by my own knowing
them, then otherwise, where I think it was more applied&mdash;to where&mdash;he said
there would possibly be some Secret Service men and possibly would be some
Federal agents I didn't know, and would I require identification from them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you understand to mean by proper press accreditation
or identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, there was one case where&mdash;there are several different
types of press cards. The only one that I would accept from them which would
be, and I think in one or two cases, was the official card either issued by the
States of Texas or by the City of Dallas, which contained the photograph of
the reporter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Otherwise, even though they had something that looked like
a press card, you understood that you were to turn them away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you in fact turn away some people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I had one particular&mdash;yes, I turned away several people that
were not press&mdash;they would try to enter the ramp. Of course, this is&mdash;normally
a person going to the jail, which is immediately off of the bottom of the ramp&mdash;a
lot of people will try to use that ramp as an entrance to the jail and there
were a lot of people that come up there and said that they were going to the
jail and I turned them away and told them to go some other way.</p>

<p>There was one reporter that come up and I believe he was with either Associated
Press or United Press, I don't recall exactly, and he had on a
sweater&mdash;first he asked me if some man was in the basement, some other
reporter, and I told him I didn't know, and he said he wanted to go down
and see him, and I told him I couldn't permit him to without identification,
and he pulled out a pass which is&mdash;I don't know how to express it&mdash;a large
yellow pass, more or less a complimentary press pass and I told him I couldn't
accept that and he dug around in his billfold and he finally did come up with
a pass. I believe this particular pass was issued by the State of California
or the City of Los Angeles, but it was similar to our official pass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you recognized that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Jack Ruby at all prior to this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, I had met Mr. Ruby prior to this time, Mr. Hubert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many times would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I would say two or three times to be at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. When I was a rookie in 1959, I met Mr. Ruby while I was working
a district out of Oak Lawn and I was more or less being trained at that
time, riding with another senior officer and an occasion arose where they had
to contact him about a white waitress that he had worked&mdash;had worked for
him and had been intimate with some colored musicians that he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you met him on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir; actually, I was just there. I hadn't&mdash;I knew the
man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did that interview last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Oh, I'd say just a very few minutes&mdash;I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was the second time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. The second time was, I believe it was in 1961, and either the
last of December or the middle of December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, I had him on a traffic violation&mdash;a minor traffic violation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize him as the man you had seen before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Not until he told me who he was and I reprimanded him and
let him go&mdash;didn't even issue him a ticket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did that interview if we can call it that, with Ruby,
last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I would say at most probably 5 minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was the third time you saw him, and I think the third
time would have been the last time, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. As I recall that's about the last time I have ever seen the
fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I thought you said there were three times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, either two or three&mdash;I couldn't be exact&mdash;I believe, like
I said, I probably may have seen him more, but you know, just passing him when
I was working on the district, but like I say, it would be difficult for me to
recall definitely the times&mdash;I can recall definitely two times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever been to either of his clubs or any of his clubs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I have been to the Vegas Club, I would say, possibly twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the Carousel or the Sovereign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I didn't even know he had the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Silver Slipper or any of his other clubs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I didn't even know he had them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the two occasions that you went to the Vegas, did you see
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Not that I recall&mdash;ever seeing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long ago were those occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. This would also be in 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, the last time you really saw him was in December 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I believe it would be in December 1961&mdash;there were other
occasions that I was in his club. I was on duty and actually just making a
routine check or answering a call there. I had actually never been in his club
except on business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On those occasions that you did go on business, do you recall
having seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No; I don't, I don't recall seeing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you stated you were posted at the Main Street ramp,
by that I take it you mean the exit of the Main Street ramp, that is to say,
where it comes out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes; out onto the street&mdash;onto the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, physically where did you maintain your post?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I maintained it inside&mdash;actually, I would say 2 or 3 feet
inside&mdash;actually&mdash;of the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you weren't on the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Oh, no; I was inside&mdash;standing inside the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The ramp is about how many feet wide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I would just have to estimate it&mdash;I would say it was 12 to 15 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were standing more or less in the middle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. In the middle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was about from 9:30 on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever leave that post?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. The only time when I ever moved out of my position there was
when this car which was driven by Lieutenant Pierce exited by that ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before we get to that, let me ask you this&mdash;you mentioned that
on several occasions people came in, identified themselves and you let them
through, or you turned away other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What steps did you take to maintain the security of your post
while you were talking to such people so that other people wouldn't sneak
through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I was still standing in the middle of the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It would be impossible, you think, for anybody to pass on either
side of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. That's right&mdash;without seeing them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, coming to the time when the automobile passed through,
tell us what you know about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, I would say it was approximately a quarter or a little
past&mdash;about 18 minutes past 11, somewhere around there&mdash;I wouldn't be exact
on the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you fix that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, they established, I think, that the shooting occurred at
11:21 and I'm just judging by the minutes before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, what you say is that you don't really have a
direct recollection of what time it was, but you reconstructed it with the information
given to you that the shooting took place at such and such a time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes&mdash;at such and such a time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let's do it this way. How long before you heard the shot did
that car driven by Rio Pierce pass by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I would say not over 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you recognize anybody in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do when the car came up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. The first thing I noticed the car&mdash;still standing inside the
ramp&mdash;and I heard someone at the bottom of the ramp holler, "Watch the car,"
and when I looked down you could just get a view of the front end of the car
coming up the ramp. It had its red lights on, which were in the grill. As
it come on up the ramp, I stepped to my right, and it come up the <span class="locked">ramp&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You stepped towards Pearl Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes&mdash;towards Pearl Street, and I stepped to my right in order
to get out of the car's way, and I stepped out on the sidewalk somewhere between
the sidewalk and the curb, I believe it was right around the curb, and I
glanced&mdash;it would be toward the eastbound traffic, which would be traffic towards
Pearl Street to see that traffic was clear, and then motioned them on
and I turned around and walked back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not go into the street at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not pass the curb?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; not that I recall&mdash;I don't believe I did at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say that when you stepped to the right and walked
on the sidewalk to the curb you looked for the traffic&mdash;to your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Actually, the way I was facing it would be to my left, which
would be west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It would be towards Harwood Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes&mdash;towards Harwood Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was your back then toward the ramp entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; my back was not toward the ramp, I was standing to
the right of the ramp where I still had a view of the ramp itself, the entrance
to the ramp. My back would have been toward Pearl Street&mdash;it would be
towards the east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever turn your head or your body toward your right,
that is, toward Pearl Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; not that I recall. All I done on that, Mr. Hubert, like
I say, I walked out&mdash;I glanced west, which would be towards the eastbound
traffic going west and due to the fact that there were cars parked along here
on Main Street, I glanced to the west and seen there was an opening in the
eastbound traffic, which would be coming from the west, and I just motioned
them on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not go out in the middle of the street to halt traffic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there many people standing around that entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; I would say at most, I believe, at most it would be a
half dozen, I think, who were standing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were they standing in front or to the side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Oh, there was one particular person that I recall that was
standing on my right, which would be toward Pearl Street&mdash;would be N.&nbsp;J.
Daniels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He is a former policeman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you recognized him as such?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he was in civilian clothes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You know that little concrete or stone projection out into the
sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that they have two of those, one on each side of the
ramp and they extend about 5 or 6 feet into the sidewalk from the side of the
building toward the curb&mdash;is it correct to say that they are about 12 inches high?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I believe they are a little higher&mdash;I believe they would be about
18 inches high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On what side of the ramp was Daniels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. He would be on the east side, toward Pearl Street there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, after the Pierce car passed by, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I walked back inside the ramp to my original post, which was
2 or 3 feet inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you stayed there until after the shot was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anyone go by you after you returned to your post, following
the exit of the Rio Pierce car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; not that I recall&mdash;I don't believe there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you qualify that by saying, "Not that you recall"&mdash;I had
understood from your previous testimony that it would have been impossible
for anybody to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, as far as&mdash;actually, when I got inside the ramp, I don't
believe there was anybody that went by between the time that I stepped back
inside and the actual time of the shooting. When I say I recall, well, I'll put
it definite&mdash;I know there wasn't&mdash;I'll put it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's the way I had understood your previous testimony,
because I had asked you as to whether it were possible for anyone to have
passed by you previously when you were examining the credentials of others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think your answer to me was&mdash;no, it was impossible&mdash;they
would have had to go either to the left or right of you and you were
standing in the middle of a 12-foot opening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to say, then, that after you got back to your post, following
the exit of Rio Pierce's car, that nobody passed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Nobody passed me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Specifically, did Jack Ruby pass you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when the Rio Pierce car was coming out, what steps or
action did you take to maintain the security of your post while that car was
passing through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. The only steps, like I said, Mr. Hubert, on that&mdash;is when I
stepped out onto the sidewalks&mdash;why&mdash;I made sure that my view of the entrance
of the city hall was not completely blocked, that I could still see the entrance
to the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You use the words "completely blocked," do you mean to infer
by that it could have been partially blocked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; the only thing&mdash;when I stepped out, as the car came
out, I still had a view of the actual entrance to the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it have been possible that part of your view was blocked
by the automobile itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. It possibly&mdash;for an instant while the car was coming out&mdash;actually
out of the entrance&mdash;but after it cleared the ramp&mdash;no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After it cleared the entrance you returned your view to your
post, even though you weren't at it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And nobody entered it at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; they did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see Jack Ruby standing by that concrete or
marble&mdash;what do you call it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Slab there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Standing by that slab there where Daniels was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there anybody else with Daniels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No; not that I recall seeing that morning. Now, Daniels worked
up there around approximately 2 or 3 feet&mdash;he was there quite some time and
during the morning there were several people that would walk by the Main
Street entrance and they would look in, more or less curiosity seekers more
than anything else. There were very few that actually stopped and there was
one particular man that did stop that I recall&mdash;I don't know his name. He
was on the left of the ramp which would be toward the Harwood Street side.
He used to be a shine boy in the basement of the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember some city hall janitorial workers, particularly
a man by the name of Fuqua&mdash;did you see any people dressed in janitorial uniforms
pass by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. As I recall, I seen some men walk down the street there and
look in the ramp and they walked on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which way were they coming from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I believe they were coming from the east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. From Pearl&mdash;towards Harwood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They just passed by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. They would have hesitated for just a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall how long before the shooting they passed by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I would just have to estimate&mdash;just an estimate&mdash;I would say
it was probably 15 or 20 minutes, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think it would have been possible for anyone to enter
the basement who was approaching the Main Street ramp from Pearl Street
or the Western Union direction, while the Pierce car was exiting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No; I don't believe it would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And why do you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Because&mdash;due to the fact&mdash;the time, the period of time&mdash;like I
said, I had a view of the ramp from the period of time the car actually come
out, and I waved it on and walked back to the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you know, of course, that Ruby says that's the way he
got in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, I realize that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your opinion about that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I don't believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think he got in some other way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I don't know definitely, but I'll say he didn't come in at the
ramp. How he got in&mdash;that, I don't know, but I know&mdash;I don't believe that he
came in the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it your opinion beyond any reasonable doubt, and I think you
are familiar with that phrase as an officer, aren't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That Ruby did not enter the basement through the ramp while
you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that opinion so strong that if you were a juror, for example,
you would convict a man or acquit him, whichever it would be, on the basis of
your statement that he did not enter at that ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, now, what do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's the reasonable doubt test, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. You mean as far as I am concerned&mdash;as far as what I think
about it, that I definitely do not think the man come down that ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But I was testing the strength of your view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, I don't quite understand or follow you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, here's what I had in mind&mdash;I'll put it this way&mdash;do you
have the moral conviction that Jack Ruby did not enter the basement through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
the Main Street ramp to the degree that if that were an issue in a case on
which you were a juror, you would say that it is beyond a reasonable doubt
that he did not enter that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. So far as the knowledge I have of it&mdash;no, sir&mdash;I do not. I think
if the question is that you think I would convict him on the doubt&mdash;of the
knowledge that I have that he did not enter that ramp&mdash;yes, sir, I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you think it is beyond a reasonable doubt, as far
as you are concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. As far as I am concerned&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember a man who turned out to be a police mechanic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Tom Chabot [spelling] C-h-a-b-o-t&mdash;I don't think I can spell
it actually&mdash;anyway, Chabot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did he enter the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Oh, this was somewhat earlier&mdash;he pulled up in a city squad
car and started into the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much earlier was it, and earlier than what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. It was, I would say&mdash;it was approximately&mdash;just an estimate,
it would be somewhere around 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, this man Chabot went into the basement about
an hour and 20 minutes before the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Somewhere around there&mdash;like I said&mdash;it would strictly be
an estimate on the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened&mdash;he tried or he went through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, he pulled up in a city squad car and I told him I couldn't
allow him in the basement in a squad car and so, he backed the car out and
he parked it on Main Street, which would be actually east toward Pearl Street
from&mdash;it would be on my right from the entrance or exit there&mdash;it would be
on the right. He parked there and he got out and he come back and he come
back up where I was standing inside the ramp, and he stood there a minute
or two and talked to me, and, of course, I had known Chabot ever since I
had been there. He's married to a policewoman, and he stood there a minute
and he told me, he said, "I've got to check the parking situation in the basement."</p>

<p>He said on two previous dates he had had to work later until about 5:30&mdash;and
so I told him to go ahead, due to the fact that I knew it was Sunday&mdash;I
seen him driving a squad car&mdash;I thought possibly maybe they had sent for
him, and there was several cars in the basement, so I told him to go ahead, and
I seen him walk down in there&mdash;I was standing, and he was standing in my
view&mdash;I could see him, and he walked down there and I got the view when he
was talking to Sergeant Dean, and in 2 or 3 minutes he had come back up. He
stopped there and chatted with me a minute and never said a thing, as far
as telling him to leave the basement, so then he got out and went and got in
the squad car and left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, tell us what happened when you heard the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, after I had stepped back in there when Lieutenant Pierce
had left&mdash;stepped back inside the ramp, it was, I would say, not over 3 minutes
I heard somebody holler, "Here he comes," and so&mdash;I turned around and glanced&mdash;I
couldn't see anything&mdash;all I could see was an outline of a few figures at the
bottom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You turned then so that your back was to Main Street and you
were looking around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I was standing to a side view&mdash;I turned like this and looked
right just like this a little way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You looked over your shoulder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I didn't actually turn, and just immediately after that I heard
something that sounded like a shot, but you know, at the point&mdash;it was something
like an explosion, but it didn't sound loud enough to actually be a shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see any movement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, at that time there was just mass confusion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I'm talking about a movement after you heard somebody
say, "Here he comes," and turned and looked back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No; sir&mdash;as far as any movement on the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, specifically, did you see any move forward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which way were you looking when you heard the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. When I heard the shot I was looking back outside the entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Onto Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me get this straight then&mdash;you were standing there facing
Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or a few feet inside the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You heard somebody holler, "Here he comes," you glanced over
your shoulder, you saw nothing that was of significance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then turned back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Then I heard the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when you turned to look down the basement after you
heard "Here he comes," you did not see Jack Ruby down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Oh, no&mdash;like I said&mdash;the only view I had was&mdash;there were so
many people in there where it was just the very people on the edge&mdash;their
backs were to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After you heard the shot, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. There was just mass confusion broke loose in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you leave your post?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I stepped back inside&mdash;the people outside&mdash;there was quite a
crowd beginning to collect outside&mdash;I stayed back inside and I drawed my pistol
and stood in the edge of the doorway in case anybody tried to come out, because
actually I didn't know what had happened, and just immediately after that I
seen some of them scuffling down there and I seen a hand&mdash;several people
scuffling&mdash;and I seen part of a hand sticking out and it looked like it had a
pistol in it, but that's all I could see was just this part of the hand, and
immediately after that there was one man that broke away from the crowd
and started up the ramp. Of course, he was in civilian clothes, I couldn't tell
who he was, and just as he started, I guess he had taken very few steps from
the crowd, there was a reserve that hit him more or less a tackle like and
almost knocked him down. Still, they were far enough from me that I couldn't
actually tell who it was. And, so, in a minute this reserve let him pass and
he come on up the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who the reserve was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; I don't. There were so many of those reserves you
know who some of them are and some of them you don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The reserves let him go and he came up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. It was Detective E.&nbsp;O. Burgess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You recognized him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you let him out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, he didn't go out. He just come up and helped me at top
of the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give you any instructions or orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No. I asked him, I said, "What happened?" And he said,
"He's been shot."</p>

<p>I said, "Who shot him?" And he said&mdash;well, he understood it was a reporter
and that was all that was said then, and then immediately after that Captain
Talbert, Capt. C.&nbsp;E. Talbert come up the ramp and he told me that if anybody
tried to leave to get their names and what they had seen in the basement, and
he went back down the ramp and shortly thereafter there was a sergeant, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
believe, it was Sergeant Everett&mdash;I'm not real positive about that, but he brought
me a book to write anybody's name on that did try to leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anybody try to leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, one man&mdash;it was quite some time after the shooting occurred&mdash;after
this, one man tried to leave and he was a reporter up here with
WFAA&mdash;Dallas Morning News by the name of Millican. I asked him his name.
He wrote his name down and I asked him what he had seen. He said he didn't
see anything, that he didn't arrive until actually after the shooting happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did he identify himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. As I recall, with a press card, if I'm not mistaken. I'm not real
positive about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember an incident in which a TV man by the name
of Jim Turner was involved? He had got out and came back in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, now, there was two men that went out during the time
before the shooting actually happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I mean after the shooting. Let me see if I can refresh your
memory in this way&mdash;a WBAP-TV man went out to get some equipment, apparently
satisfied you that he could go out, and then when he tried to come
back in again, there was another man there, who you were not allowing to pass
through, and this other man asked this man Turner to identify him to you; do
you recall that incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I recall this&mdash;there was, like I said earlier, there was two men
that went out and got some camera equipment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you said "earlier" you mean before the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Oh, yes, yes, sir; it was before the shot&mdash;it was shortly after I
was stationed on the ramp, I would say right around 10 o'clock. They went out
and got some camera equipment. I watched them as they went across the street,
the car was parked on Main Street, and then the same two men&mdash;I made definitely
sure of that, and when they come back in, they were carrying equipment&mdash;one
of these men that was in this&mdash;I don't know his name&mdash;come back to the
entrance of the ramp and looked out and he had a taxicab parked on the north
side of Main Street and he waved at that cab and he told me they were waiting,
actually, for when the transfer was made and they were going to take this cab
to the county, and after the shooting, if I am not mistaken, the same man came
back&mdash;it was immediately after the shooting, and tried to get back in the ramp&mdash;I
would not let him in. I told him definitely that nobody could get back down
there and he said he had been down there, and I said, "I'm sorry, I can't let you
back in," but he had gone back in carrying the equipment and come back and
waved at this taxicab driver after that, on the other side of the ramp, and then
went back down the ramp, and the next thing I knew he come back from the
outside, immediately after the shooting and wanted me to let him back in, and
I told him&mdash;no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember some individual who had a couple of bags and
possibly some photographic equipment&mdash;he looked something like John Carradine,
do you remember that actor, John Carradine, with a wrinkled face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This fellow had sort of an overcoat on, a tan overcoat and he
tried to get out and apparently you wouldn't let him out there because he
didn't have the proper identification, and he called upon a TV man who was
coming in and whom you knew apparently, to identify him and the TV man
said, "No, I can't identify you."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall that incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said that there was one person who came a little
later after the shooting who wanted to see Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes&mdash;this was after&mdash;oh, I would say it was approximately an
hour or almost an hour after the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who that man was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I don't know his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he look like?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. He was a great big fellow. Now, I would say he was in the
middle twenties or late twenties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say to you he wanted to see Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir&mdash;who he actually walked up and asked for&mdash;he walked
up and I overheard the conversation, if I recall, with one of the reserve officers&mdash;they
had sent some reserve officers up before that time to help with the traffic
and the crowd and I overheard the conversation&mdash;he said he was an employee of
Jack Ruby's. When I heard that&mdash;we was all standing around there&mdash;I went
and asked him and he asked me if lieutenant, let me see, I don't remember the
lieutenant's name&mdash;he asked me if there was some lieutenant there and I told
him I didn't know. He said, "Well, I am an employee of Jack Ruby's," and he
said, "I would like to talk to lieutenant&mdash;" I believe he said Cunningham&mdash;I'm
not real sure; I'm not positive now. Anyway, I asked him then what the deal
was and he said, "He just needed to talk to him," and I felt possibly&mdash;by that
time I had found out actually that Jack Ruby had shot him, and I felt possibly
maybe someone wanted to talk to him, and a reserve relieved me on the entrance
of the ramp and I went and took this man to the information desk in the
basement and I called the homicide bureau and told Detective Boyd&mdash;I don't
recall if he is the one that answered the phone, but I told whoever it was what
the circumstances was, and Detective Boyd come down to the basement and he
started searching this man and I helped him search him for any kind of a concealed
weapon he might have and I turned him over to him and I left. I don't
know the man's name, but he said he was an employee of Jack's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he a heavy man, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. He was quite a big man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old would he be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I would say he was in the middle twenties or late twenties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of complexion did he have and how was he dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I believe he had on a sportcoat and a pair of slacks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his complexion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, he was fair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How tall was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Oh, he was about 6 foot 3 or 4&mdash;he was a tall man, but I believe
he was heavier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Heavier than who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Heavier than me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would you say he weighed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Oh, I would say he weighed around 250.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he bald or balding?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Not that I recall&mdash;he had quite a bit of hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What color was his hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I believe&mdash;the best I remember I believe it was black.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice whether he had a limp or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; I didn't notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first hear that Ruby was supposed to have passed
by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I went immediately, after I took this man to the basement, I seen
another officer that was right there in the basement and I asked him&mdash;they had
already told him to go back to the squad, and so I run on up to 511, which is the
patrol office, and Lieutenant Pierce was up there and I asked him if he wanted
me to go ahead and stay on that position on the ramp out there, or what he wanted
me to do and he said to go ahead and check back in service with the dispatcher
and go back to the squad, and that was about, I would say, somewhere around
1 o'clock, and I went on back out and I answered a call, I believe I answered a
couple of calls, and I answered one out in East Dallas and while I was out of
the car, getting out of the car going up to talk to the people, they called&mdash;I heard
a call for me to call 401, at Parkland Hospital, which is the officer's room out
there at Parkland, and so I went ahead and got the information concerned with
the call and I got back to the car and went to the phone and I called. I called
Parkland Hospital and talked to Captain Talbert, and Captain Talbert asked
me if I had seen Jack Ruby that day and I said, "No." He asked me if I knew
him and I said, "Well, I know him to the point that probably if I had met the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
on the street in a crowd I wouldn't have recognized him, but to the point that
if I had some occasion to talk to him, I believe I would," and he asked me if I
had seen him and so I told him "No," and I began to wondering about it and I
went on and checked out of service and went to the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, Captain Talbert did not tell you that there
was some idea that Ruby had gone by you and got into the basement in that
way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, he may have possibly stated something like that&mdash;I
don't recall, actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you said a moment ago you got to thinking and worrying
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, actually when he asked me if I had seen Ruby that
morning&mdash;I don't really recall if he said whether that is the way he is supposed
to have come in or anything else. Well, I went on, like I said, and I
checked out and I went to 511 where I think I seen Lieutenant Pierce and
he told me that that's how Ruby said he had come into the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Oh, I would say it was somewhere around 2 or 2:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask him who Ruby had told that to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I don't believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know now who he told it to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, I understood, of course&mdash;I don't know definitely&mdash;I understood
he told Mr. Sorrels and Detective McMillon and several more&mdash;I
don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever talk to Pat Dean about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Dean asked me one time if I knew what Ruby had said, I
recall, and this was sometime later, and I said I knew what he had said&mdash;that
that's how he had gotten in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Dean tell you that Ruby had told him that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I don't believe he did, Mr. Hubert, I can't recall exactly what
it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after the event did you have this conversation with
Dean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Oh, it may have been possibly the same day&mdash;later that
afternoon, or maybe the next morning, I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he approach you about it or did you approach him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I actually don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did any of your superior officers question you about whether
Jack could have gotten by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, they questioned me quite extensively about it. That was
on Sunday it happened, and I worked Monday, and I think it was&mdash;I talked
to Lieutenant Pierce some, I believe, and Tuesday I was off and so Tuesday
morning around 9 o'clock they called me at home and told me to come in and
write a report and so I got up and went down there and wrote a report Tuesday,
and I was off Wednesday. So Wednesday night I was supposed to
be off Thursday at that particular time&mdash;I had three days off that week, and
I think it was a holiday fell in there somewhere&mdash;Thanksgiving is what it
was&mdash;and Wednesday night they called me at home, Lieutenant Pierce called
me. I don't recall that it was&mdash;whether it was 7 or 8 or 9 o'clock, and told
me to come in and go to work Thursday morning, that Chief Fisher wanted
to talk to me, and I came in and went ahead and went to work and I worked
until, I believe, 8:30 or 9 and I got a call to report to 511 on a mark-out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is a mark-out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. That means you are out of service. The dispatcher will show
you being somewhere else, and so when I went up there, Chief Fisher, Captain
Talbert, and Lieutenant Pierce, I believe, was all sitting in this little assembly
room and they were talking, and I didn't say anything else&mdash;I didn't say
anything to them, and so within a few minutes Chief Fisher asked me as I
recall, now maybe I'm a little bit wrong, as far as he asked me, but somebody
asked me if I was ready to go up to his office and I said "Yes," and we went
on up to Chief Fisher's office which is up on the third floor and I was
accompanied by Lieutenant Pierce and Captain Talbert, so Chief Fisher questioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
me about it quite extensively, and I told him the exact story that I had
in my report and I have told you, and then he asked me&mdash;he said he didn't
doubt my integrity, but would I take a lie detector test and I told him&mdash;yes,
I would take a lie detector test and I went in and Detective Bentley, who was
operating the polygraph, and so I went in and took the test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know at that time that Daniels had said that he had
seen somebody go by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir&mdash;I had contacted Daniels, of course&mdash;I didn't actually
clear my conversation when I talked to him about it&mdash;I had contacted Daniels&mdash;I
remember seeing him there, after personally knowing Daniels&mdash;I knew
him by sight, and he knew me by sight, and <span class="locked">so&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you contact Daniels?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. It was on Monday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you did so, I suppose, because you knew of the possibility
that was being talked about that Ruby had passed by you and you thought
that he was there and he might know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I knew he was there&mdash;I remember seeing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, I called him at home&mdash;he has a business down in South
Dallas, but it wasn't open&mdash;that was the day of the President's funeral, and
I called him at home and I believe his wife answered the phone, and I asked
her if I could speak to him, and so he come to the phone and I told him who
I was and I said, "I remember seeing you down there yesterday, and I just
want to ask you something." I said, "Do you recall this car&mdash;this Lieutenant
Pierce's car coming out of the basement?" And he said, "Yes, sure." And,
I says, "Well, did you see anybody go down that basement while that car was
coming out?" He said, "No, definitely not; there was nobody." And, I told
him, I said, "That's the way Ruby said he got in," and I thanked him and left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask him whether he saw anybody come by you out to&mdash;after
the Pierce car had passed through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; I don't recall asking him that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn't tell you in any case that he had seen somebody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. He said there definitely&mdash;he said there was definitely nobody
went down that ramp but that car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you that he had ever seen anybody go through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he deny he had ever seen anybody go through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir; he said he definitely did not see anybody go through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And was the conversation such that when he told you that,
you understood him to mean at any time whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. The only part I was asking him about was the point when that
car come out, Mr. Hubert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, his denial then that he saw anybody come
through, you think, because of the nature of the conversation, was limited to
whether anybody came through while the Pierce car was going through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. That was the only part that my intention was to ask him
about&mdash;was that particular one situation that arose there, because the rest of
the time I was in the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell me this, after the conversation and the examination by
Fisher and the lie detector test, and so forth, was there any kind of disciplinary
action taken against you by the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No; I had my efficiency cut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's one thing I am interested in&mdash;tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, I got cut four points.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a drastic cut?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, for me it was. Of course, in some cases it isn't.</p>

<p>I mean, it's just all according <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you see, we don't know what the efficiency cut of four
points means in terms of severity, and that's what we would like to know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, normally for the last 3 or 4 years I have always carried
a 90 efficiency, which is a fairly high efficiency, and I got cut four points on one
certain thing, which I'm not familiar enough on how they grade on that&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
actually explain it to you, but I went up to the civil service board when I got
my efficiency and checked to see who, of course, they keep a record of anybody
that changes your efficiency. My efficiency was changed by Chief Fisher. It
was cut from a 90 to an 86 and on one particular phase of how they grade you&mdash;on
dependability.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ascertain that that efficiency cut was done because of
the Ruby incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, I didn't think&mdash;I thought possibly it was over the Ruby
incident and I went and talked to one of my supervisors and I didn't feel
that I should have had a cut on my efficiency under the circumstances but the
point to me&mdash;there has&mdash;they have never actually proved that Jack came in
that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you spoke to this officer, your superior officer about the
fact that you didn't think you should be cut, what did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, he said he didn't know what I was cut for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was that, by the way, what is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I believe that was Sergeant Jennings, if I'm not mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You know you talked to Fisher about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, I was going to see Chief Fisher, as a matter of fact I got
the lieutenant to talk to Chief Fisher and he told Chief Fisher that I did want
to see him, and at that time Chief Fisher was involved in some other kind of
business he had&mdash;I don't know exactly what it was, but he was busy. Then
Lieutenant Pierce told me that I shouldn't go see Fisher at this time. He said,
"If you will wait, I will talk to Fisher."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By the way, this efficiency cut, is that on the basis of a year or
a month or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Six months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And this was made about January 1, I guess?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir; I think the efficiency ends in the month of January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Rio Pierce ever report back to you as to whether he had
spoken to Fisher or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, I talked to Lieutenant Pierce, I believe it was a couple of
weeks ago, and he said it was the first opportunity he had had a chance to
talk to Chief Fisher, and my understanding I got from him was that Chief
Fisher said it was for letting Tom Chabot in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you got the impression from Pierce, that the
efficiency cut was not related to the Ruby incident, but rather to the Chabot
incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes; to Chabot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think we need a bit more information as to the severity of
this cut. Could you give us examples of what point cut they give for what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, you might get 1 or 2 points&mdash;I've seen them get cut as high
as 13 points.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, just for different things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what would be&mdash;what would a four cut be the result of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, normally a 4 point cut wouldn't be too severe, because
actually&mdash;well, I had a 90. I got cut 4 points&mdash;I got an 86, which is still a
fairly good efficiency, but to me, like I said, under the circumstances and the
things I felt it was severe because I didn't quite understand it&mdash;that was the
point on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, were you in the police building on the 23d&mdash;the day before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir; I was there in and out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Ruby then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you in the police building on the 22d of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Ruby around there then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you happen to go to that assembly when Oswald was brought
down to see the press?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; I don't know what time that was, but at that particular
time we were working days and we got off at 3 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I show you three statements which have been marked for identification
as follows: a copy of a letter dated November 26, 1963, addressed to
J.&nbsp;E. Curry in two pages and I have marked it for identification, "Dallas,
Tex., April 17, 1964, Exhibit 5334, Deposition of Roy Vaughn," and I have
signed my name on it and since it has a second page, I have put my initials
at the right-hand bottom corner of the second page, and the second document,
which is an interview of you by FBI Agents Lester and Larson, dated December
1, 1963, and for purposes of identification, I have marked this, "Dallas,
Tex., April 17, 1964, Exhibit 5335, Deposition of Roy Vaughn." I have signed
my name on that and I have put my initials in the lower right-hand corner
on the second, third, the fourth and the fifth pages of that document, and
then there is another document, a report of an investigation of you by Agents
Hughes and Dallman, dated December 19, 1963, and I have marked that for
identification on the first page as follows, "Dallas, Tex., April 17, 1964. Exhibit
5336, Deposition of Roy Vaughn," and I have signed my name below that and
I have marked the second, third and fourth pages with my initials in the lower
right-hand corner.</p>

<p>I think you have had an opportunity to read these three exhibits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you find any corrections, changes, or modifications that you
wish to make in the document, Exhibit 5334, the letter to Chief Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you find any modifications that you wish to make in the
document that has been identified as Exhibit 5335, the FBI interview on December
1, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you take the document and tell me what changes or
what errors there are or modifications you wish to make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. This <span class="locked">part&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you are pointing to the second page, the second paragraph
which is numbered with a (1)&mdash;what do you have to say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. The time was probably 10:15 and they've got 10:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the only thing you find in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What other things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, in No. 6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the paragraph that is numbered with (6) on page two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. It says, "Thomas Carbet, known to Vaughn to be a city employed
mechanic, was on business of the Dallas Police Department in a squad
car. In connection with Carbet, Vaughn invited him <span class="locked">down"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Actually, they have Carbet, is that wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Actually, it's Chabot, but I think that's what I told him, but
that's what I meant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean Chabot, when you actually told him Carbet. The
man who is referred to in this paragraph you are talking about, Paragraph 6
on page two, was really Chabot, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir [spelling]; C-h-a-b-o-t, and that's what I have&mdash;what
he advised me that he had been sent down for, checking the parking situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don't quite get what you said is wrong with that paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, that would be all right as far as the way it is written&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, have you any comment about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Well, now, the comment was, as I recall, I did tell the two
FBI agents that were there that Chabot advised me that he had to check the
parking situation in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is omitted from that paragraph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes; that is omitted from that paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, turning to page three and it is the last long paragraph
on that page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. And it says that, "Approximately 11 a.m. a large crowd"&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
don't know how they would specify a large crowd&mdash;I said I suppose it was
probably half a dozen people standing outside the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you wish to correct that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. I want to change the large&mdash;from large to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You wish to change "large crowd at 11 a.m." to "about half a
dozen people"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any other corrections or modifications on that
document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have read it through and you believe it correctly represents
the content and substance of the interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now; I ask you whether you have any comments or changes
or corrections with reference to the FBI report which has been identified as
Exhibit 5336?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's correct altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Vaughn, would you be willing to state that if a person were
to read the three reports that we have identified as Exhibits 5334, 5335, and 5336,
and if he were to read your deposition here, that he would have the truth so
far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. Yes, sir; I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, have you ever been interviewed by any other member of
the Commission staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vaughn</span>. All right. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="JCW">TESTIMONY OF DETECTIVE JAMES C. WATSON</h2>

<p>The testimony of Detective James C. Watson was taken at 10 a.m., on March 26,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of James C. Watson of the Dallas Police
Department. Mr. Watson, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the
advisory staff of the general counsel of the President's Commission on the
Assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of President Johnson's Executive Order 11130, dated
November 29, 1963, a joint resolution of Congress 137 and rules of procedure
adopted by the Commission in conformance with the Executive order and the
joint resolution I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you,
Mr. Watson. I state to you that the general nature of the Commission's inquiry
is to ascertain, evaluate and report upon the facts relating to the assassination
of President Kennedy and subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.
And in particular, as to you, Mr. Watson, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent
facts you may know about the general inquiry. Now, Mr. Watson, you
have appeared here today by virtue of a general request made to Chief Curry
by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, who is the general counsel on the Staff of the President's
Commission. Under the rules adopted by the Commission you are entitled to
a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of this deposition, and the rules also
provide that a witness may waive his 3-day written notice and I will ask you now
if you are willing to waive the notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please stand and raise your right hand and be sworn?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. James C. Watson. James Colvin Watson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. 43.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you live, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. 2743 Clover Lane, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Clover Lane. What is your occupation and how long have you
been so occupied?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. City detective. I have been with the police department 15
years, going on 16 years. Been a detective about 8 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, were your particular assignment and duties on November
22, 23, and 24 the same as today? That is to say, same department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Auto theft bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Normally, of course, members of the auto theft bureau would
have nothing to do with homicide and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No, sir; they just took men out of each bureau to help out when
they had the lunch out at The Trade Mart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were simply assigned to assist in the transfer of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were on duty that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I have marked for purposes of identification what appears
to be a photostatic copy of a letter dated November 22, 1963, addressed
to J.&nbsp;E. Curry, chief of police, apparently signed by you, consisting of two
pages and for the purpose of identification I mark the first page as follows,
to wit: "Dallas, Tex., March 26, 1964, Exhibit 5102, deposition of J.&nbsp;C. Watson,"
and I have signed my name. That inscription is in the right-hand margin
of the letter, and on each page I have placed my initials at the bottom of the
page. I think you have read that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that statement correct? Does it contain the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any modifications or deletions or additions that you wish to
make concerning that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No, sir; only difference in that one that apparently either FBI
or Mr. Scott wrote, I show that I was in Jack Ruby's place, and it says, "several"
there, and I have only seen him one time prior to the time this happened, and
I only saw him after the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think it would be proper for you&mdash;when we get to discussing
the FBI documents that you repeat that comment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I have also marked for the purposes of identification a letter
to Chief Curry dated November 30th, 1963, by C.&nbsp;C. Wallace and P.&nbsp;G. McCaghren
concerning an interview evidently with you. For the purposes of
identification I mark that with the following inscription, "Dallas, Tex., March 26,
1964. Exhibit 5103, deposition of J.&nbsp;C. Watson," and I sign my name. That
consists of one page. Have you read that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's correct; isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in order that the record may show that we are both talking
about the same document I would like you to sign your name below mine
on both documents and initial the second page, as I have done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Initial those pages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; sign your name below mine. Right there. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. And initial the second page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Initial the second page just below my initial. While we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
on that second page I notice that is a photostatic copy and&mdash;the signature, is
that yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, then, would you sign your name below mine on the document
marked Exhibit 5103? Now, I show you a document purporting to be
a report by FBI Agent Scott of an interview of you which took place, apparently,
on November 25, 1963, and for the purposes of identification, I have marked
that document in the right-hand margin with the following inscription, to wit:
"Dallas, Tex., March 26, 1964. Exhibit 5104. Deposition of J.&nbsp;C. Watson.
Leon D. Hubert, Jr." I wonder if you would sign below my name so as the
record may show that we are talking about the same document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. This is the one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are going to have an opportunity to make the correction.
Just for the purpose of identification put your name on it. Now, as to this
document, which has now been signed by both of us and identified as 5104, I
believe you have some comments to make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I believe&mdash;I thought it was, main letter, but it was my second
letter that states that I only saw Jack Ruby one time and the FBI letter taken
from it where they show that I had saw him on several occasions. I only saw
him one time. We went in there and stayed 10 or 15 minutes. I think we had
a cup of coffee and sat and talked to him a little bit, and that is the only occasion
I have seen the man before I saw him in the basement after the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before the shooting did <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I'd say 3 to 4 years, in my estimate. I would say 2 to 4 years.
I couldn't be sure. It has been a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you did see him, did you recognize him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No, sir; I believe I would have recognized him in his place and
I did recognize him after the shooting only because I saw two or three people
call his name. Then I did recognize him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you will step over here and have a look at this mockup here
on the basement area, generally familiarize yourself with it, there is the jail
office, and that is the jail elevator, the corridor entrance, the swinging door, the
corridor outside the swinging door. There is the flat part of the ramp. There
are the two inclines back there. This is the parking area and that is the ramp
coming from the parking area to the ramp between Main and Commerce. I have
also here a chart which I have marked for purposes of identification, "Dallas,
Tex., March 26, 1964. Exhibit 5105, deposition of J.&nbsp;C. Watson." And I have
put below it my name and I will ask you to sign your name so that the record may
show that we are talking about the same document. Now, looking at the
mockup first, I would like you to show me on the mockup where you were
standing at the time of the shooting, and if you had changed positions from the
time you first went in there indicate that so that we can mark the several positions
that you might have been in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I took a position&mdash;you want it here, or over here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I want you to fix it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Generally right here [indicating]. And I had more or less,
until we&mdash;just previous to the time they brought Oswald down, I did take a point
near this corner, out somewhere, a point about like this [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am marking&mdash;is this right? Right here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am marking a circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the spot which you have indicated on the mockup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. That is the general place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The general place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. More or less milling around from there over to here, 5 or 6 feet
until right at <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The position I have marked with the circle is the position you
were in at the time of the shooting, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I have written on the map, "Position of J.&nbsp;C. Watson at time of
shooting," and I have encircled it and connected it with a line into the circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
which you have indicated was the position that you were standing in at the
moment of the shooting. As I understand your testimony, you were more or less
moving up and down along that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Well, that would have been previous, until the time they were
bringing him down. Right at the moment, the only difference would be we were
probably back&mdash;I would probably have been back, I would say, level with the
curb line, but at the moment they come out the photographers&mdash;and there were
some photographers right in this corner, and one more officer, I think, to my
left, and more or less&mdash;we moved forward just probably a couple of feet, or
three. We didn't move over 2 or 3 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You want to make this comment about the position I have marked
as your position at the time of the shooting, you say that it is correct, that prior
to the shooting you were perhaps 2 or 3 <span class="locked">feet&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Two feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Two feet back in the direction of Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes; only because as the photographers come forward, we tend
to come forward and kind <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, I am going to mark another circle then about 2 feet. This is
not going to be accurate, but the purpose of the circle is to show your position
prior to the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. They bring anyone down, people all naturally seem to move
forward a little, just close in a little.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I have written on the map and encircled the following language.
"Position of J.&nbsp;C. Watson prior to the shooting." I'll connect that with a circle,
does that conform with your understanding of the situation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what caused you to move forward in that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Just because the photographers and everyone seemed to just
move forward a little, just to keep in line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As Oswald was coming out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that accounts for the fact that your position at the moment
of shooting was a little further towards Oswald than it would have been had
you not moved at all, and that difference is about 2 feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Well, I would say not necessarily toward him, just toward the
direction he was going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was going; yes. All right, sir. Do you remember who was
on your left? What officer was on your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I believe Blackie Harrison was on my left, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was any officer on your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Not between me and the corner. I don't know whether there
was one past the corner of the building between there and the office or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think there was only the two of you, you and Blackie
Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Well, there had been one or two others over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right. I don't&mdash;only you and Harrison keeping back the press
from the Main Street ramp area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Only you two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Of course, the press was actually in the basement area, and on
the fence there on the guard rail and then at the time they had already&mdash;so
many of them had gotten over the rail, and were just inside on the ramp area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I'm going to mark an area just by making a rough oblong figure
in which I am writing in the middle "Area A," and I ask you if it is that area
that you are talking about that you were standing in front of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Just practically; yes. I was in front of, and to the right
of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; and how many people do you suppose there were in that
area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. In that "Area A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Back of you and Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Not many.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Not any at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I thought you said they surged forward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. They are over from this corner, over to about&mdash;some point right
out here [indicating], and they come over the fence and right in this area right
here [indicating]. <span class="locked">That&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am marking a line with the numbers "1," to "2," encircled,
is that the line that you are talking about that <span class="locked">depress&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. From that point "1" over to just past this corner was the only
area that I know of any photographers being in. That is where they were
supposed to be. They were all lined on the rail, but at the moment this starts,
they crawl through and come forward a little. That is what makes me come forward
a little.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I thought you came forward because of pressure from people
behind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Nobody behind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nobody at all in here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I think one or two, but no officers behind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Ruby come forward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first see Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I saw him underneath four or five detectives immediately at my
feet in front of me after the shooting. Did not see&mdash;couldn't have told whether
it was white or colored until they had him in the jail office. Four or five detectives
completely smothering him. I was standing there watching the crowd,
looked down once or twice. Couldn't tell who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first become aware that there was a shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. What do you mean? What are you&mdash;How are you going to
pinpoint <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you heard the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. When I heard the shot; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't see anybody lunge forward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I glanced at Captain Fritz. I looked at Captain Fritz, just
looked at the expression on his face, and I looked at Oswald. Second time I
had seen him, just the expression. I noticed the officers behind him back toward
the jail office, just a&mdash;momentarily, and I heard the shot up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, your head was turned in the direction of the
jail office and Ruby apparently came up from your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From the direction on your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. But, your head was turned away from the area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Glaring spotlight. We looked&mdash;straight ahead, to the right,
wouldn't look at the bright lights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you don't know where he came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No, sir; I assume where he come from but I don't know where
he come from. I know where he had to come from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let's go back to the statement that you made about "Area A,"
there, which would be area in the basement ramp, but before the incline begins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes; just a flat place there. Starts back somewhere, like you
say, back here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You're quite sure there was nobody behind you and Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No, sir; I wouldn't have left anyone behind us. I mean, we were
in a <span class="locked">position&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But I am talking about news media?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. That is what I mean, I am facing this way and all the news
media was on my left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had your back to the Main Street <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. My back to <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And nobody behind you at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Nobody behind me except officers at the top of the ramp, that I
know of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Blackie Harrison was to your left? How much space
between you and Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Well, sir; he and I were the only two in the ramp opening, in
that distance from the corner to here [indicating]. I believe we were the
only two and I <span class="locked">believe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nobody behind you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. And I believe an officer or two in here [indicating]. I don't
remember moving around so much. I mean we didn't take stationary positions
designated. Now, we just took positions as we saw fit before they came out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me mark another circle here, sir. What I am marking is
the approximate position of Harrison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I'd say 3- or 4-foot over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right there [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. That's right. I would say he would have been a little closer
than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am writing on the map, "Position of Blackie Harrison at time
of shooting," and circling that and connecting it with a small circle showing
the approximate position of Blackie Harrison. That is your best estimate of
where he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was also facing in the direction of the Commerce Street&mdash;with
his back toward Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I would think so. I mean he could have turned a little, you
know. I talked to him a couple of times. He was standing parallel just like I
am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever glance towards Main Street during the time you
were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I glanced toward&mdash;I'm sure, a couple of times. I remember the
car going out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who was driving the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No, sir; I don't know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Lieutenant Rio Pierce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I believe Lieutenant Pierce was either in it or driving it, yes.
I saw him with the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they have difficulty getting through the people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes. At what point up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the point that you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I would think that there would probably have been two or three
reporters here [indicating], and I am sure there were at this point. There
was someone that was kind of in the way, and they had to move them, I think.
And possibly right on that edge, I think all of the press were either asked or
knew to get back at about that time. I think they all got over the rail about
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had you been standing in this position before the
shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. We had been in there somewhere 20 or 25 minutes. I'd say
it must have been 35, 30 or 35 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you think that if a man had been coming down the
Main Street ramp just 30 seconds to a minute before the shooting you would
have heard his footsteps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Lots of noise going on there. Another thing, I am kind of
hard of hearing in my left ear. That is the reason, I think that I can't hear
some of the things that were said&mdash;I got it in the Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, you didn't see anybody at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No; I just remember <span class="locked">glancing&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me finish my question. Anybody coming down the Main
Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor did you hear them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you like to have a seat? Do you have anything else you
would like to add?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you consider that everything that you know about this matter
is contained in the several reports and letters that have been identified this
morning by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And in your deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nothing else you know about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nothing has been omitted, and there are no corrections you
want to make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Nothing but the FBI where it says "several". There is "one".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We have already accepted those. That has been noted, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you been interviewed by any member of the Commission's
staff prior to this deposition this morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That includes me, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you so much, sir.</p>

<h2 id="GEW">TESTIMONY OF G.&nbsp;E. WORLEY</h2>

<p>The testimony of G.&nbsp;E. Worley was taken at 9:30 p.m., on March 26, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me explain to you the procedure and then I will give you
an opportunity to ask questions and so forth. I want to introduce myself. I
am Burt Griffin, and I am a member of the advisory staff of the general counsel's
office of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, this Commission was set up under the Executive Order
11130, which is an order issued by President Johnson on November 29, 1963,
and also pursuant to a joint resolution of Congress, No. 137.</p>

<p>Pursuant to this resolution and Executive order, the Commission has promulgated
a set of rules, and in accordance with those rules I have been authorized
to take your sworn deposition, Mr. Worley.</p>

<p>I want to explain a little bit to you about the general nature of what we are
doing here. Now, I think as you probably understand, the Commission has been
set up for the purpose of ascertaining and evaluating and reporting back to
President Johnson upon the facts and all the facts that might relate to the
assassination of President Kennedy, and the subsequent murder of Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>We are particularly interested in taking your deposition today, Mr. Worley,
because we want to talk to you about what you know in connection with the
events that may have led up to and followed the death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>However, that does not preclude any information that you may have concerning
any other people. I mean concerning the death of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>I want to explain this to you, also, that you have been asked to appear here
today by virtue of a general request which is made by our general counsel,
Mr. J. Lee Rankin, and this request was made in the form of a letter to Chief
Curry.</p>

<p>Now, actually, under the rules adopted by the Commission, you are entitled
to have a 3-day written notice prior to having your deposition taken. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
the rules also provide that you can waive this notice, and I want to ask
now whether you would like us to issue the notice or whether it is acceptable
to you to waive the notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I also want to explain to you that you are entitled to have
counsel before this Commission at this deposition, and I see that you don't
appear here with counsel this evening, and I presume it is because you don't
desire one. But feel free to tell us, because there are many people that have
appeared here with counsel, and it is perfectly acceptable to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I don't think I need one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, let me ask you if you have any particular questions that you
want to ask me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I would have to say, after reading that report now, that
report from the FBI is not very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me tell you this. Then I would like to administer the oath
to you so that I can start to take your testimony. I will first hand you the
report. I will mark it for identification and hand you the report and ask you to
make any corrections. Actually, that is going to be about the first thing. I
want to get your name and so forth. Would you raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, sir, would you state for the court reporter what your
full name is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Gano E. Worley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When were you born, Mr. Worley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. February the 3d, 1926.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. 835 N. Ewing, Apt. D.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. In Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I work for Lone Star Gas Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you do for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I am building operator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you worked for Lone Star Gas Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Eleven years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you also have some connection with the Dallas Police
Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Dallas Police Reserve.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been in the police reserve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Four years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I am going to mark for identification three documents
which I have in front of me. I am going to mark for identification Exhibit
No. 5047, and I have also written on there, "Dallas, Tex., Mr. Worley, 3-26-64."
This document which I have marked purports to be a report of an interview
that you had with FBI Agents Leo L. Robertson and Paul S. Scott on December
3, 1963. Let me ask you if you have had an opportunity to read this over
before coming in here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, are there any additions or corrections or changes that
you think ought to be made in this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes; I do. If you will read this one right here [pointing].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you are referring to a letter which I also have in my
hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Right. To Chief Curry from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any particular part, if you will tell me what you have in mind?</p>

<p>Incidentally, I have marked this exhibit which you are referring to, a letter
to Chief Curry, dated November 26, 1963, purporting to be prepared by you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
Actually, this is a Xerox copy of what would appear to be another copy of an
actual letter which purports to bear your signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I have marked this, "Dallas, Tex., Mr. Worley, 3-26-64, Exhibit
5048." Now, is there some correction or addition or change that you would
make in what has been marked Exhibit 5047, the FBI interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Well, right here, if you will see it <span class="locked">says&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You want to read it so we will get it in the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. All right. "Worley reported to Central Police Station at 9 a.m.
on November the 24th, 1963, and he was assigned by the regular police sergeant."
That is wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, who assigned you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Reserve police sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Croy. That has "Regular Police Sergeant Troy".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you want to take my pen and correct it? Write in what
you think is necessary to correct it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. [Makes correction.] I tell you, this is more of an accurate
description of what I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This Exhibit 5048?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Right. Not this one, <span class="locked">because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The letter is more accurate than the FBI report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes; that tells exactly from the time I arrived at the police
station to the time I left, and every move that I made in between.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, we are talking about Exhibit 5048, which is your letter
of November 26, 1963, to Chief Curry. Are there any corrections or changes
that you would make, or additions that you would make in that statement,
that you can think of right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes; it states that I met Jack Ruby sometime when working
with squad 105, 5 or 6 months ago. That was over a year ago instead of 5 or
6 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Can you tell us how it is that you now think it
was over a year ago? What is the basis for that change?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Well, the officer that I worked with on that beat, I talked
to after that, and he hadn't worked that squad in over a year, and it didn't
seem like as long to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is that officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Regular Officer J.&nbsp;R. Sales.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you check? Is there any police record made of when
you work a particular beat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you checked those records to be&mdash;to determine when it
would have been that you last worked with that officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ask him whether he had checked the records to determine
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; but the reason that I imagine he stated that is because
he is working another squad now and he knew that it had been approximately
over a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I want you to feel free to make any changes that you want
in here, but I might suggest, and please understand that I want you to if
you don't agree with it, I don't want you to do it any other way, but it seems
to me from what you have said that an accurate statement would include
something to the effect that "I am not sure now of when it was, because I
talked with the officer and he said such and such, but I have not checked my
records, and I don't know if he has."</p>

<p>Now, I would suggest that you make some change like that, if you are
agreeable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Well, that is agreeable with me, because I didn't check the
records to see exactly when the last time I worked on that district.</p>

<p>But I did talk to the regular officer and he said that he hadn't worked that
district in over a year, so one way or the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't you take the time on that particular exhibit and
write down something that would reflect accurately what happened, on there.
You want me to write it for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. On that last sheet, the exhibit, the next one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On Worley Exhibit No. 5049.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. This one corrects that, and it says it on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. It is right down at the bottom. Now, I don't see it on
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. [Reading.] I would have swore. I read that over a little while
ago. I guess I didn't. I'm sorry, it is not in this one. I knew I seen it in one
of them. It is in the police report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is in the FBI report. Well, these are true and accurate
copies, are they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I have the letters that you gave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, I am referring to Exhibits 5048 and 5049. Now,
is Exhibit 5047 the interview report, as it is corrected with respect to Reserve
Officer Croy, is that an accurate report of the interview which you had with
those people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes; but there was some of the things that they had in here
are not what I gave them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. They aren't? All right. What do they have written down
there that you didn't tell them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Well, just like it was signed. It says Regular Police Sergeant
Troy, and it should have been Reserve Police Sergeant Croy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have made and incorporated a correction on there, haven't
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, insofar as that portion now reads, that is the way the
interview actually went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Well, then again it says here [pointing] "some stop right
there * * * to the information desk in the basement to send the other Reserve
officers to the basement parking area"&mdash;I don't see that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I said to the basement detail room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Do you want to make a correction on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. [Correcting.] I believe it is all right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If Exhibit 5047 as you have corrected it then accurately reflects
what you told the FBI agents, would you initial and date the corrections that
you have made on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. You want me just to initial this down here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Put initials where you have made corrections and a date afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. [Signs and dates.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do the same thing with that one up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. [Complies.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Would you also sign it down at the bottom and date
it with your regular signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. [Signs and dates.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, if these other copies that I have given you here, Worley
Exhibits Nos. 5048 and 5049, are true and accurate copies of letters which you sent
to Chief Curry, I would appreciate your also signing and dating those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. [Signs and dates.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I want to direct your attention to Exhibit 5048, which
is a copy of a letter which you addressed to Chief Curry, and which is dated
November 26, 1963. Do you remember when it was that you actually wrote
this letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. It was that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was. Now how did you happen to write that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I was instructed by Reserve Coordinator Capt. J.&nbsp;M. Solomon,
regular police captain, to write the letter to Chief Curry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, where were you contacted? How were you contacted by
Captain Solomon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. By telephone to my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you write that out in handwriting or did you have it
typed, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I wrote it out in handwriting and then had it typed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who typed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Mr. Worley's secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The original typed copy of that&mdash;do you recall whether that was
on a letterhead stationery or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; just on plain paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Plain letter paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You indicated here in Exhibit 5048 that you were assigned to a
position on the north side of the parking area to keep any cars away from the
first two parking spaces. And you said that you stood at that post until about
10 or 15 minutes before Lee Harvey Oswald was shot.</p>

<p>Do you recall whether when you were moved from that post an armored car
had been moved or attempted to move into the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. It was backed in the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall anything that happened with respect to that
armored car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. They couldn't get it down in the basement. It was just backed
up to it as far up in the door as they could get it, because it wouldn't clear the
top to come down in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. During the time that you were down in the basement at your
spot, do you recall whether any cars moved in or moved out of the parking area
in the garage in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. From the time that I was posted out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Until when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Until the time that you were removed from that post, did any
traffic go in and out of there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes; it was police cars coming in and out all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you stand at that post, to your best estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I understand it is difficult. Do you think you were there an
hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I was there over an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, in the period that you were standing at your
post, do you recall any other reserve officers being stationed also guarding particular
spots in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Well, there was quite a few reserve officers down in the basement,
and they searched all the cars in that basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this, Mr. Worley. I am going to pull out here a
chart, and I think we can talk a little easier about this chart. This is a map or
chart which has been prepared originally by the Dallas Police Department on
a much larger scale, and we have reduced the size of it, but it is a chart of the
basement area.</p>

<p>Now, so you understand what is happening here, over here is Commerce Street,
and over here is Main Street, and there is the jail office. Harwood would be
out where your hand is, and Pearl Expressway would be over here closer to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, will you look over there at Commerce Street. You will see
that there is a heavy black line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, that heavy black line represents the basement wall. The
basement, according to this diagram, actually extends out under the sidewalk, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
at this point approximately where the sidewalk ends there is a dotted line. Now,
that represents where the wall is if you were standing out on the sidewalk and
were looking at the building. That is where the wall goes up on the outside, so
that actually as you look at the diagram, you ignore the dotted line when you
are in the basement, because it extends all the way.</p>

<p>And on the side near Main Street, we have the same kind of dotted line, and
have the black line. It means the same thing.</p>

<p>Now, will you place on the chart an "X" on the spot that you were stationed
by Sergeant Croy?</p>

<p>Excuse me; I want to correct the record. You have stated in your letter of
November 26 that Captain Arnett placed you at a point in the basement. Can
you show us where Captain Arnett placed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, would you put a circle around that "X"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. [Complies.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at the time you were placed there, had the search of the
basement commenced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time you were placed there, were any other reserve
officers stationed at any other spots in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you remain there during the search?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall, and I am only asking for your recollection, and
if you don't remember, state that, do you recall seeing anybody come over to
this area marked stairs up and do anything there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. There was a telephone man tried to go out that stairway, and
I happened to know the telephone man. I don't know what his name is, but
he comes to our building frequently and works, is the reason I recognized him.
And he tried to get out this door, and he was stopped by a regular officer and
asked for his credentials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then was he allowed to go out that door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. About 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you observe anybody lock that door? I am asking for
your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this: Did you watch the search of the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you watch anybody search over in this area by the elevators
and the stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you see them do? Who did you see search over in that
area, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I don't recall any of the officers names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall his rank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I am not sure, but I think it was a sergeant, regular officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he a regular sergeant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was anybody else with him, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, could you tell us what he did over in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Well, these elevator doors were closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. And he checked the door to see if it was locked, and it was.
He couldn't even go out. He couldn't open the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have anybody with him at the time that he checked
that door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you have a clear recollection of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. That is hard to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You know sometimes we have a visual image, and sometimes
there is something that happened or for some reason that you know you watched
this. Is there <span class="locked">anything&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Well, there was people that they brought in a bunch of reserve
officers in the basement from the detail room, and they came out in here and
they started back in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are now sort of indicating back in the area toward Main
Street underneath the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. And he searched all these cars back in here to see that, I guess,
that there was nobody in there. They didn't tell me, but they were searching
back in here, and he just covered this back all the way to the ramp here. Then
they went right on around and covered the whole parking area down in the
basement back to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, those people were sort of moving in a group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when this regular sergeant got over to the doorway, was
that group with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or was he alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No. I am almost positive that he was over here while they were
searching back over here, and he was by himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Now, do you recall this particular officer going to the
service elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if at any time there was somebody in that service
elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall seeing any building personnel down in the
basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes; I do. Porters. And I don't recall how many. I saw some
porters and maids, and I am pretty sure that they were on this elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Service elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes; it was standing there with the door open, and somebody
told them to go on up in the building, and close that elevator off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall when that was in relationship to the search
of the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. It was before they searched the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who that officer was that did that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Would you be able to state whether it was that
officer who talked to those maids and porters? Was it the same officer, the
same sergeant who also checked this door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. There was none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You think you would recognize either one of those officers if you
saw them again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything that makes you, in your mind, convinced
about one sergeant than the other officer who checked the service elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, are you able to explain for the record&mdash;I am not trying to
trip you up or anything&mdash;I am trying to probe your recollection here&mdash;are you
able to explain to us how it is that you recall that they were different officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Different heights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; there is nothing that would be&mdash;maybe I am thinking that
they were even the same person, or different people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And in other words, your answer is that you just don't know
if they were the same?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I don't know. It could have been the same person or could
have been two different people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, now. Do you recall ever seeing anybody go over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
into this area that is marked, where it says "To engineroom", and check anything
over in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I saw them search over that way but from where I was, I
couldn't tell whether they were back in here or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After the search was over, do you recall if any other officers
were stationed down in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes. There were some more reserve officers down in the basement
stationed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you mark where the reserves were? Why don't you
put a "R" and a circle around it where there was a reserve.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. This is Lt. Ben McCoy, reserve officer. I stationed him there
myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you station him? Why don't you write "McCoy"
under his name then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes. Captain Arnett was over here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Put an "A" in front of the circle. All right, now, any other
reserve officers that you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. There was a reserve officer down here, and I don't know his
name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Put an "R" there and question mark under it. Were there any
regular officers stationed any place in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. There was a regular sergeant right here for quite awhile. I
couldn't say approximately how long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he there a half hour before Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Oh, yes; I would say it was about maybe an hour or before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don't mean for what length of time, but when did he leave
that spot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. About an hour. I would say an hour before Oswald was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall any officers being stationed by the elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes; there was a regular officer there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't you put a circle there and write "regular" under it
where that man was? Now, do you recall any other regular officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the time that you left, that was sometime after the
armored car arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Right. The armored car was backed into this ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Commerce Street ramp. Do you recall whether or not any
of these men had been moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any recollection of seeing any of these particular
men in the basement at the time Lieutenant McCoy reassigned you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes. Captain Arnett and Lieutenant McCoy and this officer
were in the basement when I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about this officer up here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You went to the corner of Commerce and Central Expressway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. The next block down. This is Central Expressway, and the
next block is north, northbound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you walk out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Went up the south ramp by the armored car, sitting right here.
And I went on this side of it, which would be&mdash;I am trying to place that. That
would be east side of the armored car. Walked down the sidewalk two blocks
to the corner of Commerce and Central Expressway, northbound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you recognize Jack Ruby if you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you recognize him then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; at the time you walked down that street, would you have
recognized him if you had seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I don't believe I would. The only time that I had ever seen
the man was when I was working with squad 105, and we made the place that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
he owned down there. We just made a frequent call, or just stopped in there
to see if there was any trouble or anything, and then went on.</p>

<p>I met him one night, and I had seen him when I was in there. But those
places are kind of dimly lit and you don't see too much in them, and really and
truly, I didn't pay too much attention to meeting him anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall if any time after the armored car arrived
any automobile came in or out of the basement area after the armored car
arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I don't believe so. I don't believe a car came down the
ramp after that armored car was backed in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see any cars drive out of the basement after the
armored car came down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you see any television cameras in any area of the
basement after the armored car arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. There were television cameras in the basement before that
armored car arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. As you walked up the Commerce Street ramp, where
did you see television cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. When I was assigned to the basement, in these first two stalls
right here, they were putting these cameras up right behind. There is a rail
that runs right along there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you mark the spot where the TV cameras were? Why
don't you put a box?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Two cameras. Two or three. There was so much confusion
down there that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you walked out to go up the Commerce Street ramp, do
you recall what television cameras you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Down in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. These two cameras that were here, that had been there all the
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall seeing any other TV cameras as you walked out?
Did you see any up here by the armored car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I don't recall of seeing any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, did you see any down on the ramp or in the garage
area, or up on this ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you indicate in here that, in your letter or statement of
November 30, that you saw from your position a man jump over the railing,
saw a man come down the north ramp, which would be the Main Street ramp,
and jump over the railing in the parking area, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long was that before you left the basement, would you
say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Hour or hour and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any thought that that man was Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. It wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, between the time&mdash;I notice this is the second report,
letter&mdash;that was you got this letter of November 30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes; I was interviewed by these two special service officers,
and they took this statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you come to describe that man? How did that come
about? Did they ask you if you saw anybody jump over a railing, or anything
like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, prior to the time that you prepared this letter of November
30, had you talked with anybody about having seen this man jump
over the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want you to think carefully. After the time, did you hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
anybody else say&mdash;prior to the time you drafted the letter, that he saw a man
jump over the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you get any indication from Lieutenants Cornwall and
Revill as to how they came to inquire about that particular man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or about a man jumping over the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. All they did is ask me if I saw anybody come down that ramp
in particular. And I stated that I had seen that man come down and jump
over that rail there in the basement, and he was challenged by an officer and
he identified himself and the officer let him go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, let me understand this then, I think your answer to me
initially was that these two lieutenants asked you specifically if you saw a
man jump over the railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; asked me if I saw anybody come down the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. And then I told them about the incident of the man jumping
over the rail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you interviewed in a room with other officers when
Lieutenants Cornwall and Revill conducted this interview? Had a number
of reserve officers been assembled together and they talked with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I was told to report to that special service office at a certain
time, and there was one other officer in the room when I came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was that officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Lt. Ben McCoy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he interviewed before you or after you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. He was just fixing to leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any conversation with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Spoke to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you mention anything about this man to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About the man coming down the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you finished with the interview, do you remember who
the next man was behind you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what time in the morning, day or night, your
interview was with Revill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. It was, oh, I believe, November 30 was on a Saturday that I
came up there. It was a Saturday, because I was off. I was at home, and
I came up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that in the morning or afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. It was in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether they had interviewed reserve officers,
had set up appointments for reserve officers prior to Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know the name of each reserve officer over here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you seen that reserve officer since the time Oswald was
shot by Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I wouldn't recognize him if I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You wouldn't recognize him again when you saw him? I am
talking about the reserve officer about whom you have placed a question mark on
the chart. Do you have anything further that you want to tell the Commission
that you think might be of any use to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I don't know of anything else that I could add to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, let me ask you this: Have you been interviewed by any
member of the Commission staff prior to this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will make this one last general request. If anything comes to
your attention which you believe could be of assistance to the Commission would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
you come forward with it, regardless of what your personal feelings may be and
so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Yes; I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will appreciate that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. I sure would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worley</span>. Glad I met you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Nice to have met you. [Add this to Worley]:</p>

<p>After Mr. Worley left, I realized that I neglected to get him to sign the chart
that we had been using to explain the various positions in the basement, and the
court reporter says that was because I was hurried. And I notice in looking at
this I also neglected even when I corrected this afterward to write after Mr.
Worley the date, so I will write that in now. 3-26-64. And I wrote that in a
space between the word Mr. Worley and an exhibit number which I had already
put on there, Exhibit 5050.</p>

<h2 id="WW">TESTIMONY OF LT. WOODROW WIGGINS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Lt. Woodrow Wiggins was taken at 11 p.m., on March 24,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

Police Department. Lieutenant Wiggins, my name is Leon Hubert, Jr. I
am a member of the advisory staff of the general counsel on the President's

dated November 29, 1963, the joint resolution of Congress No. 137, and the
rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in conformance with the Executive
order and joint resolution of Congress, I have been authorized to take the
sworn deposition from you, Lieutenant Wiggins. I state to you now that the
general nature of the Commission's inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and report
upon the facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and the
subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. Now, in particular to you,
Lieutenant Wiggins, the nature of the inquiry tonight, is to determine what facts
you know about the death of Oswald and the other pertinent facts you may
know about the general inquiry. You have appeared here today by virtue of
a general request made to Chief Curry by the general counsel of the staff of
the President's Commission, to wit, Mr. J. Lee Rankin, who wrote him a letter
asking you all be made available. The rules of the Commission provide that
you be entitled, if you wish, to a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of this
deposition, but the rules also provide that if a witness cares to do so, he may
waive the 3-day written notice and, so, I now ask you if you are willing to waive
this 3-day written notice which otherwise you would be entitled to?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes; I am willing to waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, will you stand and raise your right hand and be sworn.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, of course, Chief Curry?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, the line of command between you and Chief Curry is
Batchelor, Lumpkin, then Wiggins?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What are your particular duties?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. That depends, of course. Could I quote here and say
that on certain times I have different duties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. That I have a jail lieutenant that works for me, on
his days off, I watch the jail, or pass on prisoners and supervise the jail as
well as the other things, and when the jail lieutenant is there then I am at
liberty to inspect substations and do&mdash;the dispatcher's offices and the jail,
wherever I may be needed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On November 24, what was your situation?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I was working the jail. My jail lieutenant was off
that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, working the jail entails what responsibilities and duties?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I'm in charge of everything that goes on in the jail,
and among other duties, I pass on all prisoners that are put into jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say "pass," on them, what do you mean?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I check to see their&mdash;the arrest is legal, and that I think
the charge is proper and that this person belongs in jail before he is placed in jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, have you any duties or responsibilities with respect to
the transfer of prisoners, in your capacity as jail lieutenant?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Nothing more than as is normal to turn them over to
either the constable or deputy sheriff who transfers them to the county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With reference to prisoners who are transferred from the city
jail to the county jail, is it customary for your department to transfer them
to the county jail, or is it customary for the State deputies to come and get
the prisoner?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. It is customary for the deputy sheriff or constable
to come and get a prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know why an exception was made in the case of Oswald?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I was never told.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, normally, it would have been Sheriff Decker's
duty to come and get Oswald, is that correct?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Normally, it would have been that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know, or did you ever hear it discussed, the reason
why the normal procedure was not followed?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No; I haven't. When I make that statement&mdash;I have
surmised that it was for better protection due to the fact that we have more men,
possibly, than Sheriff Decker did. That is strictly a surmise of mine, of my own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What security had you provided for Oswald within the jail
itself?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Well, as a rule, we used a trustee to run our jail elevator.
I relieved the trustee from the jail elevator and placed a patrolman on it. And
put two officers in front of Oswald's cell at all times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is on the 24th, or at all times since he was arrested?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Well, that was&mdash;the 24th, was my first day back since that
time. I had been off 2 days prior to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when you came on duty on the 24th, did you find that security
which you have described, already in existence?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I found that they had one officer in front of the cell, but
that they didn't&mdash;they still had a trustee running the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you changed that. You took the trustee off and put an
extra man on the cell?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I suppose that Oswald was moved in the course of the 24th a
couple of times for interviews and so forth?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I know that I received a call from the fifth floor that some
detectives from the homicide bureau were up there to take him out on what they
call a "tempo," and this is to take him out for interrogation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When he was taken out that way, was he accompanied by the
guard that you assigned?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No; the guard could not take him to the interrogation
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And "tempo," is a receipt for a prisoner which relieves you,
temporarily, of the duties you have with respect to him?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. That's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when he is brought back, your duties and responsibilities
for his custody attach to you again?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you have anything to do with the search of the basement
for security?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No, sir; I was in and out of the basement looking it
over, but I had no duties with the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand. Did you remain in the jail office performing your
functions as to incoming prisoners?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. That's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know of any of the plans for removal of Oswald, or the
transfer?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I knew of no plans. I had been informed by the platoon
that&mdash;I believe that it was understood that he would be transferred after 10
o'clock in the morning. Now, that <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No one gave you any orders or assigned any duties to you in
connection with the transfer?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did any sheriff come with a warrant for his release?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, under normal circumstances would you allow a prisoner
to be removed by the city police?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He would be out of your custody on "tempo," is that right?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Not necessarily. Let me say this: that the&mdash;that the
city police transfer prisoners on occasion over to the county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. But, this is rare. It is&mdash;there are instances I can name.
For instance, they have filed on a prisoner and just for courtesy to the prisoner,
more or less, he wants to get to the county and they just transfer him on down to
the county themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you relieve yourselves of responsibility in those circumstances?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Each prisoner who is transferred, the card is signed, or
the name of the officer that is making the transfer is placed on his card. His
property is turned over to the officer making the transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was this done in this way?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No; in this case, they were going to take the property
later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Naturally, he was in the custody of Captain Fritz at the time
of the transfer, isn't that right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had been released from your custody by a "tempo" card to
Fritz?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. That's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Fritz could do what he wanted with him? Until he relieved
himself of the obligation of the "tempo" card by putting him back in your
custody?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. That's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When were you first aware that Oswald was going to be moved
in the immediate future?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. When was I aware that he was en route, <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Or, being moved to the county?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I'd say possibly a minute before the shooting occurred,
they called me&mdash;someone called me from the&mdash;Captain Fritz' office, the homicide
bureau, and told me they were en route down the elevator with Oswald,
and I know that when I hung the phone up I looked in and could tell by the
elevator lights it was on the way down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in your statement you fix that moment at 11:20. How do
you fix that? Do you remember now how you fixed that?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I remember looking at our clock as they came by. I
don't know why, but I looked, just to be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the big electric clock, that is on the wall there?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Big electric clock on the wall there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The wall that is adjacent to the ramp?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Well, I don't know what you mean, "adjacent to it,"
it is directly&mdash;on the wall directly in front of the hallway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, as you come into the jail office, from the corridor, that
clock is on the wall to your right?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that an electric clock?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you all check it frequently?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No; but maybe just occasionally might call the bank to
get the time, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you estimate just how accurate that clock is, normally,
and was on the day in question, the 24th?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No; I would say that it was possibly, I'm sure, not
over 2 to 3 minutes off either way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think that there could be a 6 minutes difference?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No; I certainly don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you see what I mean. In other words, you say it could
be 3 minutes off either way, then there could be a difference&mdash;no, I see what
you mean. Could be a difference of only 3 minutes. Have you ever known
it to be that much off?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Not to my knowledge. I don't recall the time that
<span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, being an electric clock the only thing
that will stop it from working is if the current went off, is that right?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes, sir. And, now, I don't recall on any particular
details of ever having set that clock for&mdash;or anyone having set it. I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you rely on that clock for timing other events in your
business of running the jail office?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Repeat that question. I am not sure I understand
what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I take it that the time of various events, like the time of a
prisoner's release on bond, or the time that he is actually brought in is a
matter of record in some instances, with the police?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the time and the entry of that time on the
record is a part of your function?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you rely on that clock?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Most of the time. Sometimes I look at my watch,
but most of the time I look at the clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, 11:20, you have as the time you first noticed the elevator
coming down, and in a few seconds after that I guess they passed by?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No, sir; the time at 11:20 that I am speaking of,
I remember I looked at the clock as they were coming out of the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was 11:20 just then?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Of course, that is only a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, they passed by you?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. As they came down, and as they came off the elevator
Captain Fritz was the first man off, and he said, "Are they ready?" And I know
that then I stepped out of the door, and I don't recall whether I ever answered
him or not, but I stepped out into the corridor first. If I would have answered
him I am sure I have&mdash;would have told him that it was ready, but I don't
recall whether I did or didn't because I presumed they were ready, as everyone
else did, and I know I stepped out into the corridor, to the left as you went out
the door. I stepped to the left possibly 3 or 4 feet from the door, and they
passed me then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On your right?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes, sir; they passed me with Oswald at that time, and
had proceeded past me approximately 6 or 7 feet when the incident happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see any shooting at all?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I heard the shot, and did see the gun, but at&mdash;but not
at the time of the shooting. I saw the gun after the officers had grabbed it and
had swarmed Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Describe Jack Ruby coming out of the group.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I saw a man coming out. I had no idea who it was, but,
I mean, it happened so quickly I caught it in the corner of my eye, and I saw
him out of the corner, saw him coming out of the crowd, but I didn't know at
that time who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just about what position in the crowd did he come from?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. If you were familiar with that location I could tell you
exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, we have here a mockup of the area, and also a corresponding
chart that you can use, and for purposes now of identifying it, I am
going to mark this document as follows, "Dallas, Tex., March 24, 1964. Exhibit
No. 5076, deposition of Woodrow Wiggins." And I am signing my name to it,
and I ask you, for the purpose of identification to sign beneath my name. Now,
first of all, you&mdash;using the mockup to get your own position, and then secondly,
I ask you to mark on this chart that we have identified your position by placing
a circle actually at the place where you were.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Where my position was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the time the shot was fired.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. All right, sir. I had come out of this door and I had
stepped to along here, just about there [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just put a circle there.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am writing&mdash;you have marked a little mark there and
I have put a circle around it and I am marking here, "Position of Wiggins at the
time of the shot." And circling that, is that correct?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. That is prexactly (sic) correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now on that same map would you put a mark which I am also
going to circle later and identify as to the spot as best you can recollect it where
you first saw Ruby coming out.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. The spot where he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where he was.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. When I saw him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; the spot where he was when you saw him. Now, look at
the mockup first and get your distances.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I have an idea or just <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you just mark it there, the spot there were you first saw
Ruby?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Approximately. I could miss this a foot or 2, you
understand that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. All right. Now, your cameras were over here behind
the&mdash;behind this with the lights, and where I saw him, he was approximately,
I'd say, about there [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am marking this&mdash;Lieutenant Wiggins has marked a spot
in the basement area. I am putting a circle around that spot, and connecting
it with a line, I am writing "Position of Ruby when seen by Wiggins." Is that
correct, sir?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes. Now, this spot that I would be&mdash;that I would say
to be to where I first noticed that&mdash;the movement that attracted my attention
right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. And by the time that I had time to think and look, it was
over, but that is approximately the place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. You had known Jack Ruby before this, I understand?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes, sir; I have known Jack Ruby for years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first recognize him?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. The first time that I recognized him, who it was was after
they brought him into the jail office. He was on the floor still covered, or surrounded
by the officers is when they picked him up off the floor and stood him
on his feet in the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say anything to you?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I don't recall him saying anything there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever talk to him afterwards?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes, sir; I talked to you the&mdash;I talked to him the next
morning. I went up to see if he was all right. This was approximately 6:45,
the following morning, I went to see that he was all right. I asked him how
he was feeling, and he said, "As well as could be expected." And I asked him if
he was being treated all right. And he said, "Yes; they are treating me fine."
And I don't recall saying anything else to him at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you&mdash;have you spoken to him since?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who called a doctor?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes, sir; when the shot was fired, as soon as I saw that I
could be of no help out there, they had Ruby. They had the man, and they were
surrounding&mdash;I immediately whirled, came in the office, and when I found one
of my officers there, Slack, I told him to call the doctor, that Oswald had been
shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you then notice what time it was?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No, sir; I didn't. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Slack was where?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. He was standing right by the desk inside the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, he put the call in?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes, sir; he called himself, then let me say this, that after
they brought Ruby in, then I turned and came back out the door and after they
had brought Ruby and Oswald, after they had gotten him in I checked by telephone
myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did you speak to then?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I called one of them in the dispatcher's office, but I don't
remember who I checked with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am marking a document purporting to be a letter dated
November 27, 1963, addressed to J.&nbsp;E. Curry, chief of police, apparently signed
by you, by marking on the right-hand margin these words, "Dallas, Tex., March
24, 1964, and Exhibit 5074. Deposition of W. Wiggins." I am signing my name
on the first page, and placing my initials on the lower right-hand corner of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
second page. I am marking a four-page document purporting to be a report of
an interview with you by special agents of the FBI, Chapoton and Smith, dated
December 2, 1963, by writing in the right margin on the first page of that document
the following: "Dallas, Tex., March 24, 1964. Exhibit 5075, deposition of
W. Wiggins." I am signing my name and I am placing my initials on a second,
third and fourth page of that document by putting those initials in the lower
right-hand corner. I ask you to look at these two exhibits and tell me whether
you have had an opportunity to read them?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do those documents represent what you know to be the truth?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes; there is an error on the third page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of which one?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Of the document taken by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state what you consider to be the error and give us what
you consider to be the truth?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. It starts on the eighth line, on the top of the third page
where it starts&mdash;the sentence starts, "They had proceeded some 6 or 7 feet&mdash;"
Excuse me. It is the one in front of that. The latter part of the last sentence
of the eighth line. Sentence reads, "In their midst, were out past him. Wiggins,"
and it should read, "In their midst, went out past him. Wiggins." And the
next <span class="locked">sentence&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I'm not sure I got that distinction.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. All right. See this? See this then should be, "Went
out past him." Not, "were out past him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, in the eighth line, the fourth word from the end
of the eighth line should be the word "went" instead of the word "were," is
that correct?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. That's true. Also, the next sentence, as it is written
here, "They proceeded some 6 or 7 feet from the jail office door when he, Wiggins,
saw a man lunge towards Oswald and he heard the report of the gun." That
sentence should read, "They had proceeded some 6 or 7 feet past Wiggins when
Wiggins saw a man lunge towards Oswald and he heard the report of a gun."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, as the exhibit itself now reads, or as the sentence
now reads it gives the impression that they had proceeded 6 or 7 feet from the
jail door.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whereas, your recollection is that it was 6 or 7 feet from where
you were standing, and were you&mdash;you were standing about 3 or 4 feet from the
jail door, so that to catch the sense properly it would be that they had proceeded
about 10 to 11 feet past the jail door.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, are there any other corrections or modifications?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No, sir; rest of it <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are there errors in either of those two exhibits?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. The rest of it is as <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any omissions that you would like to correct, <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No, sir; nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anything to be deleted?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Wiggins, have you been interviewed by any member
of the Commission staff, other than myself?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, with respect to myself, we had an interview last night,
did we not?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, are there any inconsistencies that you are aware of between
the matters discussed in our interview last night and your deposition taken
tonight?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Well, we didn't discuss this last night. You and I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you discuss it with <span class="locked">Mr.&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. We&mdash;I didn't discuss any of this. The only thing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
I discussed with any one last night was with you, and that was that the time
and so forth that I would be here tonight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, I see. When did you get to read your statement?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. Last night. You gave your report to me last night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, we had no other discussion?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No, sir; not on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, in fact, there was really no interview with&mdash;even with me?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. When you speak of interview, I meant conversation.
I did have conversation with you last night, but not anything pertaining to this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nothing inconsistent that happened between the interview of last
night and what you said today?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor, I take it, is there anything of a material nature that transpired
in the interview of last night which has not been developed tonight?</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. I don't believe I quite understand what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In view of the fact that you have already stated we had not
discussed it, I think it answers itself, but the point I am wanting to make
is there was nothing that was talked about last night that we didn't talk about
today, obviously that is so, because it wasn't talked about last night.</p>

<p>Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wiggins</span>. That's true.</p>

<h2 id="DRA">TESTIMONY OF DON RAY ARCHER</h2>

<p>The testimony of Don Ray Archer was taken at 8:20 p.m., on March 25,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of
the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Don Ray Archer, isn't that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Archer, my name is Leon D. Hubert. I am a member of
the advisory staff of the general counsel on the President's Commission under
provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and the joint
resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the President's
Commission in conformance with the Executive order and the joint resolution.
I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you, among
others. I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission's inquiry
is to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relevant to the assassination
of President Kennedy and subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In
particular as to you, Mr. Archer, the nature of the inquiry today is to determine
what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent facts
you may know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Archer, you appear today by virtue of a general request made by
J. Lee Rankin, general counsel of the staff of the President's Commission to
Chief Curry. Under the rules adopted by the Commission, you are entitled to
a 3-day written notice prior to the taking of this deposition, but the rules
adopted by the Commission also provide that a witness may waive this 3-day
written notice if he so wishes. Now, do you desire to waive that notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I will waive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Will you stand and raise your right hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Don Ray Archer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your last name is Archer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I am 31.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. 2035 San Francisco, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I am police officer for the city of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been on the police force of the city of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Ten years, May 31.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What particular duty or function do you have with the police
department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I am a detective assigned to auto theft bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is your immediate superior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. My immediate superior would be Lieutenant Smart, and then
Capt. J.&nbsp;C. Nichols, who is the head of our bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have the same position and rank and duties and occupation
during the period of November 22 to 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, where were you stationed when you first came on duty
on November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. On November 24, I reported for duty at 7 a.m., at the auto
theft bureau, which is my normal procedure when I report for work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then did you go about performing your regular duties in the
auto theft bureau, or were you assigned extra and other duties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Well, at the beginning of the morning I was performing my
regular duties and carrying out my assignments and making my general investigations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is in connection with routine auto thefts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you taken from that routine of duties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By whom, and at what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. As I recall, and as near as I can recall, and this is only approximate,
about 8:40 a.m., Lieutenant Smart came into our bureau and advised us
that Chief Stevenson had asked us to stand by to remain in that bureau, to await
further orders, which we did. And I continued carrying on what work I could
there in the office concerning my reports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that the first order you got was to remain where you were,
not move out, and stand by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Not to leave, that's right, and to be there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. What happened after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Well, as near as I can remember we did stay in the&mdash;in the
bureau, or at least I did until, oh, I would say approximately 10:50 a.m. And
that is only an approximate time because I don't remember looking and seeing
the exact time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what happened at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. At that time, Lieutenant Smart came in and, of course, we had
been aware that the subject, Oswald, would probably be transferred that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What made you aware of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Well, for one thing, just the press itself, and quite a bit in the
papers and all. We just had it in our minds that we would. Actually, nobody
told me specifically that he would be, but like I say, it was in my mind. I just
had that impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, at approximately 10:50, you received orders from whom, you
said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Lieutenant Smart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To do what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. He told us to follow him and to go to the basement, which we did.
We left our office and walked to the elevators, got in the elevator and then
proceeded into the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which elevator did you use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. We used the interior elevator, of which there are two moving
from the basement to the fourth floor. It is generally inside the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The public elevator? Not the jail elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Oh, no, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were in uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. No, no, sir; I was in civilian clothes, much as I am right now.
White shirt, tie and suit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't wear uniforms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. No, sir; I am a plainclothes officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you referred to "we" indicating that there were several
of you there. Who were the others? Do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I couldn't name you all the officers, I know Detective Clardy and
Detective McMillon and Detective Dawson and Lieutenant Smart and myself
were on this. We rode down in the same elevator. That's all I recall. There
were other officers that eventually gathered in the basement, riding down, that
is the only ones that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did that party move as a party as you left the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. As a group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what I mean. Where did you move to from the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Well, after we got onto the&mdash;into the basement&mdash;the elevator
door was open&mdash;now, we got off and walked to in front of the jail office and
I believe Lieutenant Smart told us to standby there for further orders. Then
he walked away, at that particular time and I stayed standing against the south
wall, the south wall which was opposite the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that outside <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Outside the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Outside the jail office doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Well, no, sir; it is before you leave the corridor, going into the
basement in front of the jail office, but not into the basement entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. It would be hard for me to say the exact time. In general I'd
say about 5, maybe 7 minutes that we stayed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then where did you move to next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. While standing there in front of the office, Captain Jones came
through with Chief Batchelor, passed in front of us, entered the basement and,
as I recall, they stood there and had some conversation. I didn't hear the
conversation. Couldn't tell you what it consisted of, but after seeing this talking
to Chief Batchelor, Captain Jones came back and said, "I want this corridor
kept clear," and at the same time he did, the doors opened up. This was the
corridor going into the basement in front of the jail office, "I want the corridors
kept clear," and he didn't necessarily order me. He indicated&mdash;just said, "I
want the corridors kept clear," and that is when I took my station on the north
side of the jail door, right where the corridor goes into the basement, and also
where the jail door opens into the basement where the automobiles are parked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell me about what time it was that you took that station
that you just described last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. May I&mdash;my approximate time&mdash;oh, sir, I couldn't give you an
exact time from the time that would elapse, I would say approximately 11:05, or
11:08 a.m. Like I say, that is only an <span class="locked">approximate&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let's try to get at it another way. About how long before the
shooting did you take that post?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I would say at least 15 minutes previous. Prior to the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you leave that position that you have just described in any
substantial way? I understand you weren't standing stock still, but substantially,
did you remain in that location until the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like you to have a look at this mockup here and at the
basement chart which is in conformity with it, and I am identifying this particular
basement chart that I am going to ask you to testify about by marking on it,
"Dallas, Texas, March 25, 1964. Exhibit 5091. Deposition of Don Ray Archer,"
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am signing my name on it, and for the purpose of identification,
I will ask you to put your name below mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you&mdash;use the mockup first to determine the exact spot that
you were standing in at what we'll call your final position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In which you were approximately 15 minutes before the shooting.
I say, using this mockup, I want you to place yourself wherever you were,
and relate it to the map or chart, or draw a circle in the spot at which you
were. First of all, show to me on the mockup where you were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I was at this position right here, sir. In other words, this
door&mdash;this door here [indicating] had it been open&mdash;in fact, it was open. I
was helping to hold it open. Right on the corner of this particular&mdash;it is not
exactly a pillar, but just to the corner of <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If I put a circle right here, would that be the spot you are
talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes; it would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am making a circle and drawing a line out, and I am writing,
"Position of Archer for about 15 minutes prior to the shooting." I am drawing
this circle around that legend, and connecting the circle which marks your
position with the circle which describes it, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes; it is as near correct as I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When the party came out, then the doors swung in to you,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Sir, as I remember it, when the party came out, now, as near
as I can recall, the doors [were] open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Opened which way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I just couldn't say. I have thought about that, but I don't
remember exactly. I'd say&mdash;as I was showing you here, I was standing enough
to this side to hold this door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To hold <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. This is the door [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The corridor door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. The corridor door, yes, sir; not the jail office door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember whether the jail office door sort of cornered
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. No, sir; it couldn't corner me. It didn't interfere with me at
all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is a swinging door, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir; it is. I am sure&mdash;I feel like in my own mind, it was
open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Swung open into the jail area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Swung open into the jail area. In my own mind, as I say, I
can't be certain about that point, because I just don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I suggest to you that if you had&mdash;if it did open the other
way, it would have kind of boxed you in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I don't believe it did. That is the reason I have it in my mind
that it was opened the other way, because I recall no interference from the
door whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don't remember being boxed in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I know I wasn't boxed in, no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what happened then when the party came down that
was transferring Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Well, as they brought Oswald down to the basement, now, the
first officer that I saw was Captain Fritz. As he started out the jail office
door he stopped and paused, and whether he said something to the detectives
with Oswald, I don't know. He didn't&mdash;motioned to them like for them to
wait a second, like I say, I didn't hear any command or any orders given at
that time, and then he proceeded to walk out, and I would say probably at that
particular point, took about three paces. Then the detectives started out with
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, as the party moved, they moved away from you, I guess?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, they were in your line of vision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir; they were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Well, as they passed in front of me, I could see&mdash;I could see
the detectives on each side of Oswald leading him towards the ramp. The
automobile ramp in the basement. Then as they neared the front of the
ramp&mdash;now, keeping in mind that in this position that I was in, I did have
some bright lights shining into my eyes, and that because of these lights it
would be hard for me to recognize someone on the opposite side of the ramp.
I mean, you know, without focusing my vision directly on them. In other
words, I couldn't take a scanning view and possibly recognize just anyone, but
as they approached the ramp, just as they reached the edge of the ramp, I
caught a figure of a man. The movement first turned my attention to that
point. I had been watching Oswald and the detectives, and more to my right,
and then I caught the movement of a man, and my first thought was, as I
started moving&mdash;well, my first thought was that somebody jumped out of the
crowd, maybe to take a sock at him. Someone got emotionally upset and
jumped out to take a sock at him and I started to move forward, and as I moved
forward I saw the man reach Oswald, raise up, and then the shot was fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you were in motion before the shot was fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Well, I would say just it would be instantaneous. I mean,
when I saw the movement I feel like I started moving, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first recognize Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I didn't recognize Ruby at all. I didn't know the man personally,
and I didn't know his name (nor I didn't even know who admitted the
shooting) until following the shooting when they asked him his name and he
said, "You all know me, I'm Jack Ruby."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that when he was overpowered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. That was as we took him back to the jail office after the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he make any observation or remark or say anything at
all before he was moved into the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Sir, an instant before I heard the shot, I heard a phrase. Now,
I couldn't say what the phrase was and then I <span class="locked">definitely&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you don't know what the phrase was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. No, sir; I don't know. I couldn't say what the phrase was,
because I had not heard, but I did hear the words, "Son-of-a-bitch," and then
the shot was fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who said it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir; I know Ruby said it. I'm positive of that. I was
looking right at the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean that you didn't hear anything except those four
words, "Son-of-a-bitch"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. That is the only words I could make out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you knew it was coming from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir; I thought that it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far were you from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I would say, at that particular time, I was five, maybe six paces.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did he move from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Sir, when I saw him, he was approaching the detectives. It
was my first glimpse of it. I, personally, could not say where he moved from.
He came out of the crowd, as far as I could tell, because that was all that was
around was the press and officers, lining the corridors so far as I knew, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could he have come up from the area where the television
cameras were located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir; he could have. When he came into my vision, he was
already in front of the detectives, and I did not see exactly where he did
come from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What detective was he in front of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Detective&mdash;the ones that had Oswald, which would be Mr.
Leavelle and Mr. Graves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what detectives Ruby passed by in his motion
from his prior position to when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. No, sir; I&mdash;my own personal knowledge, now, well, if you are
speaking about that time, I did not; no, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you are saying, I think, is that you found out subsequently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes; subsequently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But at the moment, you didn't recognize them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. At the time if someone had asked me who had been standing
there, I couldn't have said, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then, he was brought into the jail office immediately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. After the shot was fired, sir, I tried to move forward, but I
was cut off by the other officers. The&mdash;I started forward, well, the struggle
went to my left as I moved forward, individually worked itself way around
in back of me, and just as they reached the jail office, well, I took his left
arm and assisted them in walking&mdash;I went into the jail office with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. What happened next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. After we took him into the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. After we got the subject into the jail office I still didn't know who
he was. Someone asked where the gun was. Now, I had not, up to this point,
seen the gun other than just an instant after the shot was fired when I caught
sight of this man again, which was Ruby. I didn't see the gun. I was interested
in knowing where the gun was, or if he still had the gun and we took
him on into the jail office and I assisted in keeping his left arm behind him
and someone got his right. I couldn't say who it was that had his other arm.
Laid him down on the floor, his head and face were away from me at that
particular time. But that is when I said, "Who is he?"</p>

<p>I made that statement, because I didn't know who it was and Ruby then
turned his face in my direction. He didn't look directly at me. His face
had been turned in this manner [indicating]. He then turned in this manner
[indicating], and he&mdash;that is when he said, "You all know me, I'm Jack Ruby."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened next in that jail office area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. When we had the subject on the floor, I was reaching for my
handcuffs. I reached back in this manner [indicating] to unhook my handcuffs
off my belt, and Detective McMillon was astraddle and over him, over
Ruby, and I believe I said, "Mac, do you need my cuffs?"</p>

<p>About that time, "No; I have got it now." And said he placed the cuffs on
Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. After he got the cuffs on him, there were still&mdash;oh, there was
still lots of confusion going on, and several statements were being made or
being asked. I don't know. They seemed&mdash;some of the statements seemed to
come from behind me. I don't know whether it was reporters looking into the
jail office or just who it was, but there were some statements made inquiring&mdash;several
people were asking, "Who is he?" Did he hit him? Did he shoot him?
Or things of that nature, as I recall. And he said at that particular point, "I
hope I killed the son-of-a-bitch."</p>

<p>I think Captain King was there just a very short time. We began to get&mdash;McMillon
and I and Detective Clardy, I know the three of us and perhaps one
or two other officers, I couldn't say for sure, assisted Ruby to his feet, and we
started toward the jail elevator with him, along with Captain King. I believe
Captain King said at that point in there somewhere, "Let's get him onto the
elevator and take him to the fifth floor jail." So, we then went to the elevator.
They put him on the elevator, and I believe that I was either last, or near the
last getting on the elevator, and then we proceeded on to the fifth floor jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do when you got up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. After we got to the fifth floor jail we took him back to the investigative
section of the jail, which is just an open section, not a cell. Just
an open section of the jail, and we began to search him for any weapons. We
were, at least I was mainly concerned as to whether he had any other weapons
on him at all. We stripped him and stripped him of his clothing, and I wasn't
interested too much in personal property, but mainly searching for weapons or
bombs, or anything else he might have concealed on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you find any personal property on him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Did I find any personal property on him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir, I searched him. I did remove some personal property.
I recall a large roll of money and perhaps some change. I'm not sure about that.
The main thing I remember was the large roll of money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do with the property you took from his person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. We had been there&mdash;before I started removing any personal
property; well, I searched him by feeling of him, you know, feeling for any
weapons first, and then one of the other jailers, uniformed jail officers, Haake,
came up and what personal property I took out of his pockets, I handed right
over to him. I didn't bother to itemize it or anything else, because that is their
job, not ours, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn't make an inventory of his property?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I didn't; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You just handed it over to another man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to Ruby then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. During&mdash;after we&mdash;as I began searching him, making the general
search of him, as we were standing there I said&mdash;I had seen Oswald on the
floor in the jail office after he had been brought in there and I looked at him,
and to me he looked like he was dead. Of course, I couldn't say he was dead,
but I am saying that to me he looked like he was dead, and I said to Ruby at that
time, "Jack I think you killed him," and he just looked at me right straight in
the eye and said, "Well, I intended to shoot him three times."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. No, sir; I didn't know him. I wouldn't recognize the man if I
saw him on the street. I do&mdash;I knew of him. I had heard the name before.
I did have&mdash;I did recollect that he had been handled by the department, but I
never arrested him, and I had never seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you knew the name was Jack Ruby, though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You knew the name was Jack Ruby, though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I didn't know the name was Jack Ruby other than he told me his
name was Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am handing two documents, which I'm identifying as
follows, to wit: One document apparently is a copy of a statement dated November
27, 1964, addressed to Chief Curry, apparently signed by you, which I
am marking, "Dallas, Tex., March 25, 1964. Exhibit No. 5092, deposition of
D.&nbsp;R. Archer," I have signed it on the first page, and I have initialed the second
page by marking my initials on the lower right-hand corner, and another
document which I have marked in the right margin, "Dallas, Tex., March 25,
1964. Exhibit 5093, deposition of D.&nbsp;R. Archer," and I have signed my name
below that, and put my initials on the second page, bottom right-hand corner.
And I would like you to examine those exhibits, please, and then after you have
done so, I wish to ask you some questions about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Now, <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you read both of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I have read this one [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. You want me to <span class="locked">read&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; read both of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. All right. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have read the exhibits we have marked 5092 and 5093.
Now, I will ask you if those statements contain the truth as you knew it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir; with one correction here in this statement that is
headed by "Federal Bureau of Investigation".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you will find that that is Exhibit 5093.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. 5093, yes, sir. It is not correct when it states that I remained
with Ruby until approximately 3 p.m. I believe that that was 3:30 p.m., as
stated in my report. As I recall, when I was interviewed by the gentleman, I did
say 3:30. Now, like I say, it could be my error, could be theirs, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any omissions from, of fact from those statements?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Any what, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any omissions of fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Well, I didn't go into every detail. There are several statements
that I didn't include in this report, and of some of the conversation that took
place in the jail and during the time that I was with Ruby, and then some of
the statements that were made downstairs. By this, I mean when this investigation
was made. I didn't have in mind of any testimony being involved, that
it was&mdash;more or less an investigation as to how Ruby got into the basement, and
what the security breakdown was. That my&mdash;that was my impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you are relating to the fact that both of those statements
omit any statement as to what Ruby told you concerning his intent to kill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I wish to afford you an opportunity to state why that fact,
or those facts were omitted from the statements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Well, at the time, I just didn't consider them pertinent to the
investigation that was in progress, and I just didn't recall them as important
information at the time. And as I explained, it was in my mind that it was
an inquiry, more or less, as to where I was and what I was doing, and of an
inquiry as to whether there was any negligent on my part in regards to this
security breakdown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think that the inclusion in these two statements of his
phrase "Son-of-a-bitch," was more important than his statement of his intent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Sir, at the time, it is like I say, whenever I gave the statements
I had in mind as to what I saw at the time of the shooting, and that did take
place at the time of the shooting, and I didn't go into great detail as to what
took place after we took him into custody, took him upstairs and searched
him and all. In other words, I had in mind that if anyone wanted to know
about it, well, they would be afforded a chance for me to relate that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When, in fact, did they find out that you had this knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I don't recall the exact time or day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you file another report than those we have here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I have another report that is the part mental interview which
was taken, as I recall, from the date, on November 30th, which was a continuing
inquiry as to how Ruby got into the basement of the city hall. I believe that
it was taken by Lieutenant McCaghren and Lieutenant C.&nbsp;C. Wallace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In that statement you did not mention what Ruby told you concerning
his intent either, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. No, sir; I did not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first convey that information to anyone at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. To Mr. Alexander with the district attorney's office, when he made
a court inquiry at the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I don't remember the date, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, how long after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I just couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, was it before Christmas, for example, or after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I don't remember. I do know that <span class="locked">Alexander&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before the trial began did you convey this information
to anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I would say approximately 3 weeks. Now, that is just a guess,
because I just don't recall the time there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, tell us the circumstances under which this inquiry was
made of you concerning the intent to kill as expressed by him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Mr. Alexander made the inquiry in talking to us together, and
also individually, as to what we heard that might be pertinent, what might
not be pertinent at that time, and I went over and related all that I could recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was the first time you mentioned to anyone at all what
you had heard Ruby say regarding his intent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. As far as I recall; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was about 3 weeks before the beginning of the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I would say very&mdash;approximately. That could vary, because I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
don't remember the date. I wish I could, but I didn't make any particular
note of it. Like I say, at the time, I just didn't take note of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, do you mean to say to me that you did not regard
those two statements made to you by Ruby as being important in a trial of this
man for first-degree murder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. No, sir; I didn't say that I didn't regard them as important.
I just say at the time that these statements were made it was in my mind that
it was not necessarily a gathering of facts to try the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I gather from your testimony that you didn't convey this
information to anybody at all until you were asked to do so in an interview with
Mr. Alexander, which, from your testimony, I judge to be approximately the
middle of January or afterwards, which is to say, 2 months after the event.</p>

<p>Now, I ask you if you did not think that that information was extremely
valuable information in a pending prosecution for first-degree murder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. I didn't, at the time, give it a thought in the way of prosecution,
because in my own mind I didn't feel that a lot of the statements would
be admissible. I don't know what would be admissible and what wouldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It never occurred to you that it was your duty to tell your
superior officer, or somebody that you had heard that this man said, "I meant
to kill him"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. No, sir; it didn't. Had they inquired about it, I certainly would
have told them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, have you anything else to say, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. No, sir; not unless there is something more you would like
to ask me. If I can relate, or tell you anything, I would be happy to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now you have not been interviewed by any member of the
Commission or by me, before, have you? That is to say, a member of the
President's Commission, on the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Not the President's Commission. I have been interviewed by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which you know about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But no interview by me or any other member of the Commission
staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This deposition is the first time you have said anything to any
member of the Commission staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archer</span>. Yes, sir; so far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. That's all. Thank you, sir.</p>

<h2 id="BSC">TESTIMONY OF BARNARD S. CLARDY</h2>

<p>The testimony of Barnard S. Clardy was taken at 2:45 p.m., on March 24,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of

Division, Police Department of Dallas. Mr. Clardy, my name is Leon
D. Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff of the general counsel of the
President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. Under the

of President Kennedy and subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.
In particular as to you, Detective Clardy, the nature of the inquiry is to determine

that a witness may waive the notice. Now, do you waive this 3-day notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Very well. Now, will you stand and be sworn, please. Raise
your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Barnard S. Clardy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Thirty-seven.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. 936 Ferncliff Trail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Police Detective.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so occupied, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Since November 5, 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been connected with the criminal investigation
bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Since December the 5th, 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, is&mdash;who is head of the auto theft bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Captain Nichols.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Captain Nichols, and the entire criminal investigation division,
of which the auto theft division is a part is headed by Chief Stevenson, is that
right, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Chief Stevenson; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Detective Clardy. I'm going to mark three documents as
I will indicate, after which I wish to ask you some questions concerning those
documents. At first, a document consisting of three pages being, apparently, a
copy of a letter dated November 27, 1963, addressed to Chief Curry, the original
of which was apparently signed by you, B.&nbsp;S. Clardy? I am marking the first
page of that document "Dallas, Tex., March 24, 1964, Exhibit No. 5061. Deposition
of Detective B.&nbsp;S. Clardy."</p>

<p>Under which I am signing my name, and I am placing my initials in the right-hand
lower corner of the second and third pages of that document. The second
document purports to be a report from the FBI concerning an interview with
you on November 25, 1963. I am marking that document in the lower right-hand
corner as follows: "Dallas, Tex., March 24, 1964. Exhibit No. 5062,
Deposition of B.&nbsp;S. Clardy," and I am signing my name and putting my initials
on the second page in the lower right-hand corner.</p>

<p>The third document consists of three pages, and purports to be a report of an
interview of you on December 3d, by Agents Quigley and Dallman of the
FBI. On the first page I am marking as follows, to wit: "Dallas, Tex., March
24, 1964. Exhibit No. 5063. Deposition of B.&nbsp;S. Clardy." Signing my name on
the first page, placing my initials on the second and third pages in the lower
right-hand corner on each of those pages.</p>

<p>Now, Detective Clardy, I hand you these three documents and&mdash;identified as
5061 and 5062 and 5063, and ask you if you have had an opportunity to read
those today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do those documents represent substantially the truth of all you
know concerning the matter under inquiry this morning&mdash;this afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir; they do. The only thing that I find that I erred on
was in the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, <span class="locked">now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. On my statement, that the approximate time where I went down
was approximately 11 instead of 10, and the approximate time that we brought
Mr. Jack Ruby from the jail to Captain Fritz' office was approximately 3:30,
instead of 2:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Those corrections you wish to make on the document marked
5061?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. 5061.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understood it, there were two time corrections that you
think should be made, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. On that document alone, sir. And this was approximately closer
to 11 a.m., on this other document.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let's see. You wish to make a correction as to the time with
reference to Clardy Exhibit No. 5061, to wit, your letter to Chief Curry on November
27th <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. And on that also. It was approximately 3:30 instead of 2:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Two corrections here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir; two corrections on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And in the second paragraph of that letter where you name
the time as 10 <span class="locked">a.m.&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Approximately; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As the time at which Lieutenant Smart advised you and other
officers to report to the jail office. You now say the time should have been what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Should have been 11 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Should have been 11 a.m. Do you have another time correction
to make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Time on the last paragraph there was the time that we brought
the prisoner out, Mr. Ruby, to Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It reads now as "2:30 p.m."?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. It reads 2:30. It should have been approximately 3:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Should have been 3:30 instead of 2:30. Both of those corrections
being as to Clardy Exhibit No. 5061. Did I understand that you might have
a correction as to Clardy Exhibit No. 5062?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Clardy Exhibit No. 5062. This. The second paragraph should
have been approximately 11 a.m., instead of 10 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, your best recollection is that the time that Lieutenant
Smart advised you and other officers to go to the city jail office was 11 o'clock
rather than 10 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything you can tell us that would explain that
error in time that you made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You see, the point I am making is, that on November 27,
you stated 10 a.m., apparently in your letter. Then&mdash;well, prior to that, on
November 25, when you were interviewed by the FBI you told them at 10 o'clock,
and do you think that it is simply a mistake in time, <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Well, it is a mistake in time on me&mdash;on the&mdash;on my first report
I was under the impression that I told them 11 a.m., which&mdash;now, whether
I did or not, I don't know, sir, on my first interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me call your attention to the fact that on Document 5063,
which is the interview on December 3, you also mentioned 10 a.m., apparently.
All I am trying to do, Detective Clardy, is to find out why it is that you think
it is 11 o'clock now, whereas before on three separate occasions you thought
it was 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Sir, I thought I told the agent that I talked to that it was
possibly closer to 11 than it was to 10, when I talked to him. To be&mdash;just
preactly [sic] what time I went down there, I am just judging.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, your present recollection is <span class="locked">definitely&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. That it would have been closer to 11 than it was to 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I am definitely sure in my own mind that it was sometime
after 10:30.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything that causes you to fix that precisely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. After just thinking, and all the other officers up in the bureau
sure that it was closer to 11 than it was to 10, I don't know whether I looked
at my watch or whether&mdash;on a previous deal, or where I got the 10 o'clock
in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, it is apparent then that you did have 10 o'clock in your
mind until when speaking to others you became convinced that you must be
wrong and the 11 o'clock is closer to it, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir; I am sure it was that. I wasn't any&mdash;wasn't in the
basement more than 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anyone speak to you and ask you to correct your statement
from 10 o'clock to 11 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are doing that on your own volition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is because you have become convinced that you are wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I was wrong on the time, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. That 10 o'clock is definitely wrong on time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you are, right now telling us that you are quite certain
that it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. That it was closer to 11 o'clock than it was to 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That it was closer to 11 than 10. And that the previous statement
about 10 o'clock is simply wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Simply wrong; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No one has asked you to change?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir. That wrong time was my fault, and nobody else's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anyone speak to you about the wrong time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Haven't done so to this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I understand that you were off duty on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that you did not participate in reference to the investigation
concerning the President's death on November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had you known him, and in what way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I had known him approximately in the neighborhood of 8 or
9 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what way? How did you come in contact with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. To the best of my recollection I met him when I went into his
place of business that he owned on South Ervay in connection with work, when
I was working as a patrolman. I say I met him. I didn't meet him at that
time. I knew him, knew who he was. I&mdash;first time I was ever introduced to
him, shook hands with him, was at&mdash;after I went into criminal investigation.
Possibly in the early part of 1956. I was looking for someone in connection with
an auto theft in the vicinity of one of the places that he owned and he had
an interest in the Vegas Club. I'm not sure who I was with, or who <span class="locked">introduced&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you speak a little louder, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I am not sure who I was with, or who introduced me to him
at that time. Then approximately&mdash;maybe 6 or 8 months before this come up
he stopped me downtown one day and started telling me about a traffic ticket
he got. Other than that, I had seen him at a distance and had spoke to
him. I had seen him quite frequently when I was working late nights where
the B and B Club is, that is on Oak Lawn, close to Lemmon. There is one
place of business between the Vegas Club and the B and B, and we would go
in there quite frequently when we were working late nights, and I have seen
him in there on several occasions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was your acquaintance with him such that you would recognize
him immediately upon seeing him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you recognize him in that way, whether he had a hat
on, or a hat off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I know the man well enough if I caught a glimpse of him I
should recognize him; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, I am going to mark a chart of the basement
area of the Dallas Police Department, as follows, to wit: "Dallas, Texas,
March 24, 1964, Exhibit 5064. Deposition of B.&nbsp;S. Clardy," under which I am
signing my name. For the purposes of identification, however, before I move
to that, I want to ask you concerning documents 5061, 5062, and 5063, previously
identified, which I now hand you again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ask you if there are any other corrections you wish to <span class="locked">make&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With reference to the documents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does the information contained in those documents represent
the truth, so far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any modifications or changes or deletions that you would like
to make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I don't believe there is, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anything omitted, that you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Sir, the only thing that is not in there that I know anything
about is possibly some of these people that come in and talk to him after we
took him upstairs, which nobody that made any of these investigations asked
me about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. I will get to that later, but with the exception of
these omissions that you just mentioned, and to which I will come back at a
later time, these documents represent the truth? There is no deletion and
nothing more to add other than that other matter we have been talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I'll ask you to put your name under my signature where it
appears, and your initials under my initials where they appear on each of
the documents. Right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Right under here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes. Just&mdash;now, we'll be using this chart later on, which has
been marked 5064, and I have signed it, and I will ask you, for the purposes
of identification, to put your signature under mine on that one, too. Now,
these documents have been corrected, I understand, that it was simply closer to
10 o'clock than to 11 that you <span class="locked">received&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Closer to 11 than 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I beg your pardon. Closer to 11 than to 10 when you received
certain instructions from Lieutenant Smart, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were these instructions the first connection that you had with
the movement of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. We had been told earlier that morning, approximately&mdash;come on
duty at 7 o'clock, and was&mdash;and was told to stay in the office. Now, <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, your normal tour began at 7, but you were told
to stay in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Was told to stay in the office, that we would have to move the
prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Lieutenant Smart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you anything about how the prisoner was going to be
moved, or at what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I was under the impression that he didn't know what time or how,
hisself, at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What caused you to form that impression?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I think we went to get a cup of coffee, and I asked him, and he
said, "I don't know."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the impression that he didn't know what the
plans were, actually came from the statement that he himself actually told
you to the effect that he didn't know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then what happened after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Sometime shortly before 11, they told us to report to the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Smart did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Lieutenant Smart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Lieutenant Smart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Lieutenant Smart, myself, and Detective McMillon, Detective
Archer and Detective Watson, and Detective Dawson out of our bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You moved as a group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Uh-huh, all down on the same elevator, and there was some
other detectives from the juvenile bureau, I am sure, was on the same elevator.
Detective Lowery, Detective "Blackie" Harrison, and possibly some others.
Those, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What instructions were given to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Went to the basement. Lieutenant <span class="locked">Smart&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Speak a little louder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Lieutenant Smart is the one, the only one who had any orders
as to what he wanted us to do. Said, "Line up along the wall here on each side."
and help keep the people back out of the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Well, I tried to, sir. Don't look like we done much good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I did not mean that to be facetious. I was simply following
the line of thought. Then you followed his instructions to line <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I want you to take a look at this mockup here and show
us where you stood, if you did stay in one place, from the time that you got
down in the basement area until the shot was fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Let me get lined out here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I was on this corner to&mdash;just to the right of it, most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let's see. That would be here, isn't it? [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have marked&mdash;you have indicated on the mockup here
a position which I am now marking by a circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I was just down from the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, <span class="locked">I'll&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. In other words, I was close enough to the corner that I could
see around both ways. One occasion, I went and talked to Detective McMillon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you took this position, and went over there and
came back, and this is where you were at the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. At the actual shooting, I had moved approximately 3 steps to
my right. As they backed this car out, apparently, some reporters tried to
come across here [indicating]. And I had stepped up that way, not over&mdash;not
that far up, sir. I only took 2 or 3 steps. I would say maybe probably
as far as from me to you. I had stepped to my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now, I have marked on Exhibit 5064, as a result of
what you have stated while looking at the mockup, 2 positions concerning you.
One of which I have marked, encircled, "Position of B.&nbsp;S. Clardy prior to shooting,"
and second one, which is, you say, is approximately 3 feet further towards
the Commerce Street entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which was your position at the time of the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. At no <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir; might add something a little further, that at no time
other than when I walked across to Detective McMillon do I recall being over
3 feet from that corner in any direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first get to that corner, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. That would have been approximately 11 o'clock, maybe 10:55.
It would have been pretty close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that from the&mdash;from between 10:55 and 11 o'clock you
stayed in the position which is marked on Exhibit 5064, that being the position
of B.&nbsp;S. Clardy prior to the shooting. You stayed in that position all&mdash;within
3 feet of it the whole&mdash;during the whole time until Oswald was shot, except
on one occasion when you said you went over to talk to Detective McMillon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far did you move, and in what direction did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Certainly&mdash;well, sir; he was across the aisle on the other side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, would you mark on the map approximately the position of
McMillon when you walked over to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Approximately&mdash;I walked over to him approximately in here
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am marking a circle, now, and I am putting on there, "Position
of McMillon when Clardy walked over," right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, did you go back to your original position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand you to say that you stayed there except at the
moment of the shooting you were about 3 feet in the direction of Commerce Street
from that original basic position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us why you moved 3 feet towards Commerce
Street, as you say you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. The best of my recollection, as they backed the car out, that there
was some of the press tried to come in front of the car, and I had to step to my
right to watch them, and I stepped to my right and Captain Fritz had come into
my view and stepped down to the right and turned slightly to my right, and
approximately at that time, I hadn't seen Oswald myself, but approximately
at the time I stepped to my right I saw a blur of fast movement and I tried to
turn, and heard the shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you recognize Ruby then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I had not seen him to recognize him; no, sir. Just all&mdash;I was
turned, moved to the right, and all I could see was a fast blur of movement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At any time during this time that you were standing in your
original position as marked on the map, or at any time when you went over
to see McMillon, or at any time for that matter, whatsoever, did you see Jack
Ruby in the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir; I did not; and approximately 2 or 3 minutes before the
shooting I had looked over the crowd in the basement. Why, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did, in fact, look over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I had looked up to the right. Lieutenant Smart, and&mdash;I think&mdash;I
am not for sure&mdash;Chief Batchelor was with him at the armored truck, and I did
look on over the crowd on back around. Now, this could have been more than
3 minutes before the shooting occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were the conditions such that if Ruby had been standing in
that crowd you could have singled him out and seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. As many people as there was in there at the time, sir, he could
have very easily been behind somebody where I couldn't have seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just how many people were in that area where Ruby apparently
was? I don't mean an accurate count. Of course, you didn't count them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. In the area where I presume that he come from, 12 to 15, on
over behind the rail there was quite a few people, whether he come across the
rail, whether he come down the ramp, like he told us, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, the Main Street ramp itself going toward Main Street, you
figured there were about 15 people?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. From along here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Don't say "along here," because that won't show up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. So that we'll understand what I mean here, take this. There
was people back over in here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let's call that area "B" and you are talking about area B,
and you say there was a considerable amount of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Considerable amount of people back in there and from along
here [indicating], across and along in here [indicating], there <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am drawing a semicircle, is that approximately correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I am calling that "line X to Y."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I'd say there was a minimum of 15 people from here across here
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Minimum of 15 people in the front row, or some in the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. There were some in the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you think there were about 15 people strung along this line
that we have marked "X to Y," being a curving line, in&mdash;and that there was
some back of them, and up the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. At the time, I didn't see anybody back up in here anywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, you didn't see <span class="locked">anybody&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I didn't see anybody back as far as this [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, the second line which you have described, "as far as this,"
is&mdash;I'm going to mark that line and put it, for purposes of identification I'm
marking it as a line designated by "1" and "2." Both numerals being encircled.
I should like you to consider the area which is bounded by these two lines,
"XY," and "1, 2," and the rail and at the wall is area A. Tell me how many
people you think were in area A?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. In this area here? <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In area A, which has been designated by you as being encompassed
between line "X" and "1," that being a curving line. Line "1,"&mdash;point
"1" in a point to point "2" in a circle, the rail and the <span class="locked">wall&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I'd say there was approximately four or five people up and down
here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are describing with the <span class="locked">pencil&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Where the circle is down across here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are describing with the pencil about four or five people along
the rail lining of the basement side of the rail, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;no, sir; on the ramp side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ramp side, parking area side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir; on the ramp side. Not the parking area side. On the&mdash;this
being the ramp here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Coming off from Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see what you mean, on the ramp side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. On the ramp side. There was a couple of uniformed officers in
this area. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. McMillon was one of them, wasn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, it was. You put his position, also, did you see W.&nbsp;J. Harrison
in that group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. W. J.? That is a detective in the juvenile bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I don't know. I can't testify. I am not&mdash;well, that's all
right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Sir, there was a detective, I am pretty sure the one you are talking
about. I don't know him real well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That's all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I don't know whether it was Harrison that was along in here
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, would you make a circle and state where you think
"Blackie" Harrison was at the time of the shooting?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Time I saw Detective Harrison, to the best of my knowledge, he
was along in there [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am marking that circle by putting "Position of 'Blackie' Harrison
at time of shooting," is that correct or at the time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. At the time I checked, looked over the basement, which would
have been approximately 3 minutes, 2 or 3 minutes before the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw him 2 or 3 minutes prior to the shooting. Now, I'll ask
you to check that again, that circle that I have designated by the legend, "position
of 'Blackie' Harrison at the time Clardy saw him 2 or 3 minutes prior to
the shooting." Is that approximately the position of Mr. Harrison at the time
designated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the time you looked over the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In that area, again, can you tell us about how many people were
concentrated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Including a couple of uniformed officers in that area, there was
possibly six or seven people in that area at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the time you looked over at the crowd then you could see
that if he stays behind this crowd of people looking up the Main Street <span class="locked">ramp&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see anybody come down at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see any movement there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir. I saw the&mdash;I say "movement"&mdash;I saw the car that
Lieutenant Pierce drove out that ramp, and at the time that the car approached
the top of the ramp there was nobody in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see the car at the top of the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Sir, the car now as it went out&mdash;let me get this straight here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Don't use the map now, if you can do it without it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Let me get it straight here. I watched the car drive out until
he drove approximately half, or maybe three-fourths of the way up, and at that
time, clear back down to here [indicating] there was nobody in between.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Now, as to what&mdash;watching it drive on up to the top of the ramp,
no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not see it drive to the top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, roughly between half and three-fourths of the way up the
ramp? Were you looking in that direction after the car had passed out of the
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, do you think this, if anybody had come running down there
you would have seen them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Sir, it is quite possible that somebody could have come running
down there and I wouldn't have seen them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not, in any case, see anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I did not see anybody. Now, I was facing more over in&mdash;oh,
almost straight across the ramp after I looked over <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Over the crowd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Over the crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you looked over the crowd prior to the time the car passed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not look over the crowd then&mdash;after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think it is possible from your position that anybody could
have come down that ramp and you would not have seen them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What makes you think that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Well, I wasn't just in particular watching toward the direction&mdash;at
the time that Lieutenant Pierce come out, there was a lot of these
people moving around, and I was trying to keep an eye on them. At the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
the other car was brought out&mdash;being brought out, there was a lot of those
people over in this area in here moving around [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I think you have already testified that as to the actual
shooting itself, you just saw a movement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Off to your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Just a blur of movement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first identify Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. After he had been taken inside the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you speak to him then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. As I went inside the main jail office they had the cuffs on him,
and Detective McMillon said, "Well, let's take him on upstairs." And said,
"Barney, take my gun."</p>

<p>I took Detective McMillon's gun out of his holster, and at the time I did,
Jack Ruby said, "I'm Jack Ruby. Don't you know me? Don't you know me?"
Said, "Yes, I know you, Jack," something to that effect. I am not sure, because
I was sick to my stomach of what had happened, and then seeing him and wondering
in my own mind how in the world a man had ever got in there. I took
Detective McMillon's gun and mine and put it in one of the lockers in the jail
office there, which is provided for that purpose. And along with Detective
McMillon, Detective "Blackie" Harrison, and Detective Archer, and there was
some other detectives on the elevator with us, and I'm not sure who, and we took
Ruby directly to the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he make any comments during that trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Sir, I was on the&mdash;I was the last one that got to the elevator.
If he was&mdash;made any comment on the way up I didn't hear him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, in your statement to the FBI agent which has been identified
as No. 5063, you stated he did mention other things. That you had heard
Ruby mention that he had intended to get off three shots, do you recall that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. That was after we got upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I am not sure who asked him the question. I believe it was
Detective Archer, and asked him in some way, "Did you intend to"&mdash;or, "Did
you think you could kill the man with one shot?" And he said, "I intended to
get off three shots." Said, "I didn't think that I could be stopped before I got
off three shots." But, that, <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask Ruby, or did anyone ask Ruby in your presence how
he had gotten into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I asked Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did by yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I asked him myself, and I am sure there were several others
who did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was when you were up on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir; shortly after he <span class="locked">got&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Shortly after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you ask him, and what did he reply? What did you
ask him first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I asked him how he got into the basement and how long he had
been there. I don't know whether that is the exact words I asked him in or
not, and he said that Lieutenant Pierce, or he called him Rio Pierce&mdash;I believe
said Rio Pierce, Lt. Rio Pierce drove out in the car and the officer stepped out
from the ramp momentarily to talk to Lieutenant Pierce, or said something to
him, and I come in behind him right on down the ramp, and says, "When I got
approximately halfway down the ramp I heard somebody holler, 'Hey, you,' but
I don't know whether he was hollering at me or not, but I just ducked my head
and kept coming."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say anything further?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Further stated, said, "If I had planned this I couldn't have had
my timing better." Said, "It was one chance in a million." Or something to
that effect. Said, "If I had planned this, I couldn't have had my timing any
better."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he make any statement to you as to why he had done it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. He said&mdash;no, somebody&mdash;I was going to ask him, and I am sure
some other officer asked him as to why. He said, "Somebody had to do it. You
all couldn't."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the only explanation he offered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Well, later on we talked to him a little further and he went into
this long story about how much he thought of President Kennedy, and how he
was remorseful. Didn't want Mrs. Kennedy to have to come to testify on a
trial, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say anything here to indicate that he had any accomplices
in his act?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he mention to you that he had been to the Western Union
that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say anything about where his car was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say anything about there being a dog in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Sir, I recall that he said there was some money in the car. I&mdash;I
don't recall him saying it in my presence, about the dog being in it. I do recall
that he talked later about some dogs that he had that he thought so much of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now, a bit earlier when I asked you whether or not
there were any omissions from the documents, Exhibits Nos. 5061, 5062, and 5063,
you indicated there was an omission concerning what had been said to you by
some people who had talked to you. I think that is what the omission&mdash;it was
something along that line. Do you recall what that was now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Well, I think some of the stuff that we have gone into there
that you have asked me as to some of the things that were said, or on down
the line that I don't&mdash;I don't recall any of the FBI agents asking me who come
up there and talked to him, whether they did or not, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, can you tell me what you had in mind a little while ago
in the deposition when you said, "Yes, this is all right, but there has been
omitted something," and I told you at that time, "Well, we'll come back to it a
bit later," and now, I am coming back to it. I was wondering just what you
had in mind when you stated that there had been an omission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I don't believe it is in that report that Secret Service agent, Mr.
Sorrels, came up shortly after we arrived and talked to Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Whether that is in there or <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that what you had in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. That and the FBI agent, Mr. Hall, then came up and talked to
Ruby off and on until the time that he was taken to Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long a period was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Sir, he was up there probably within 15 to 20 minutes after we
had taken Mr. Ruby upstairs. Agent Hall was, and he talked to Mr. Ruby
at considerable length until he had several telephone calls. I don't know who
they were from or what they was about, but, that he was called to the telephone
several times while he was up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Mr. Sorrels was present also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Mr. Sorrels had left before Mr. Hall come up there. Sorrels had
talked briefly to Mr. Ruby. I say, "briefly," he&mdash;approximately 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let's see if I can get the time sequence. Within 15 minutes after
Ruby was brought to the top&mdash;to the fifth floor, Mr. Hall came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And interviewed him, with some interruptions by telephone calls,
for approximately what, now, an hour and a half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. I'd say Mr. Hall was up there 3½ hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Three and a half hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in the 15 minutes or so before Mr. Hall came, Mr. Sorrels
came?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Mr. Sorrels came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And stayed about 10 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Mr. Sorrels came up just very briefly. Very shortly after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that what you meant when you mentioned a little while ago
that there was some omissions from your statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. That is what I had reference to; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have reference to any other omissions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, let's put it this way. You have already stated that what
is in these records, these three exhibits, 5061, 5062, and 5063, are true and correct;
that you did not want to modify or change anything that you had previously said.
That it was some omissions, and now, do I understand you to say that the omissions
that you previously spoke of is what you just testified to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are there any other omissions that you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. None that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that by taking Exhibits 5061, 5062, and 5063, together with
your deposition today, is it fair to state that there is on record everything you
know about the assassination of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, other than the interview that you had with me earlier
today, have you been interviewed by any member of the Commission staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, the interview you had with me was prior to lunch, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you state now whether there are any inconsistencies between
your deposition and what we discussed at the interview to which I have just
referred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Nothing other than the&mdash;you were referring to those previous
statements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I am referring to any inconsistencies between what you
testified today and the interview we had this morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, have you provided, or had&mdash;or did you provide in that interview
this morning any material as to which you have not testified to in this
deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything else at all that you would like to state that has
not been said in one way or another by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Sir, the only thing that I could add in any way, that I can think
of, would be that the&mdash;Mr. Ruby appeared to be normal on that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then do you think you knew him well enough to be able to judge
whether he was normal or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. From his expressions or the way he talked led me to believe that
the man was normal, that he knew what he was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, other than that observation then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. It wouldn't be anything that I could think of that I would add.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; if you do think of anything, I want to ask you to please
feel free to come forward and state it, because quite frankly, a person will forget
something, and if you do remember anything, don't hesitate to come forward
with it, even though you might say to yourself, "Well, I have already said there
is nothing more, and now I am coming back to add something." I ask you not
to feel that way, but on the other hand, to feel free to come forward, because
the Commission wants to know all the facts, and we want to get the facts, even
though you may not recollect them until after this deposition is over. I trust
you will do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Clardy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then, thank you very much. I want to thank you
personally and on behalf of the Commission for your assistance. Thank you,
sir.</p>

<h2 id="PTD">TESTIMONY OF PATRICK TREVORE DEAN</h2>

<p>The testimony of Patrick Trevore Dean was taken at 8 p.m., on March 24, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me state for the record, first of all, introduce myself. As
you probably heard I am Burt Griffin. I am a member of the advisory staff
of the general counsel's office of the President's Commission to Investigate the
Assassination of President Kennedy. Now, this Commission was set up under
an Executive order of President Johnson, dated November 29, 1963, called Executive
Order No. 11130. Also pursuant to a joint resolution of Congress. We
have adopted a number of rules and so forth which I will explain to you a
little bit beforehand, pursuant to all these resolutions, I have been authorized
by the General Counsel to take the deposition of Sgt. P.&nbsp;T. Dean, who is right
here.</p>

<p>I want to tell you a little bit about the general nature of the inquiry that
we are going into here. As the title of the Commission would indicate,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice.</span> I hate to interrupt, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As I say, I want to tell you a little bit about the scope of this
inquiry that we are going to go into. We have been authorized to inquire
into and evaluate and report to the President on all the facts relating to the
assassination of President Kennedy and all the facts surrounding the death
of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Calling you, Sergeant Dean, we are particularly interested in the facts that surround
the death of Oswald, although we don't mean to preclude any other
information that you may have which may pertain to the whole area in which
we are going. There has been a written request made to Chief Curry, by the
general counsel of our Commission staff, asking that you appear here some
time during this particular week. Now, this is not quite in full keeping with the
rules that have been set forth by the Commission. Under the rules of the
Commission you are entitled to a 3-day written notice prior to having your
deposition taken. This is going to be sworn testimony. The rules also provide,
however, that you may waive this notice. I want to ask you right now,
Sergeant Dean, if you are willing to waive the written 3-day notice which you
can require us to give you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes. I will waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Now, I also want to tell you that you are entitled, under
the rules of the Commission to have an attorney present, if you want, and I
notice you are not here today with an attorney, and I presume that is your
desire, but do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I will waive that, also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Now, will you raise your right hand? Do you solemnly
swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you state for the record your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Patrick Trevore Dean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. 2822 Nicholson, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dallas, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. 11 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you hold any particular rank in the department?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I am a sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been a sergeant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. 6 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What section were you assigned to in the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Patrol division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That was on November 22, 23, and 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, it's my understanding that you were not on duty on
either November 22 or 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are these your regular off duty days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time did you come to work on Sunday, November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. At 7 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Prior to the time that you came to work, had you heard anything
about the proposed move of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; well, before I came to work, no, sir; I hadn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before you came to work did you know that Oswald was
going to be moved that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Just rumored that some time during the day that he would be
moved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How had you heard that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, rumors in around city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you been around the city hall on the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or the 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where then did you hear these rumors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I had just come into town just about the time the President landed
on Friday. I had been out to south Texas deer hunting, and that day, I, of
course, listened to all the news about the assassination, and also the next day,
on the 23d, and then on the 24th at 7 o'clock is when I reported for duty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, you indicated to me, though, that you had heard rumors
around the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. This was on the 24th. They had said that sometime during the
day that Oswald would be moved. Now, who they are would be in the captain's
office, around in the captain's office and in my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Referring to that period before you came on duty, had you
heard any rumors then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So when you arrived you didn't have any idea that Oswald was
going to be moved that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Repeat it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you arrived at 7 o'clock Sunday <span class="locked">morning&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn't have any idea Oswald was going to be moved that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this: Did you drive down to work that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where you parked your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That being Sunday, I believe I parked in the 2100 block of Jackson
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you recall how you entered the police department
building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. On the Commerce Street side going to the basement. Not into
the parking area where the incident occurred, but going into the police and
courts building from Commerce Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you entered at 7 o'clock&mdash;I know it's difficult to pick out
what you saw at one time and what you saw at another time. Did you see any
TV <span class="locked">cables&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Strung through that entrance?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; numerous television cables and cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Try to think back as best you can and tell us, as you walked
in from Commerce Street, you know, you come down the <span class="locked">steps&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have to open the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that will take you into the hallway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That leads to the records room. Now, as you got into that area
there where you open up the door and so forth, did you see any TV cables
strung through that doorway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; I believe there was a lot of TV cable down at the end
of the hall there, toward the jail office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well now, talking now about right up at <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did any TV cables come through that Commerce Street entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do when you got inside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I went immediately to the basement, changed clothes into my
uniform and then went to the second floor, which is patrol captain's office,
where I report for duty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you report to there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Captain Talbert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you have a conversation with Talbert at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Nothing specific; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Talbert give you an assignment at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Talbert talk to you in anyway about the movement of
Oswald at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you learn somewhere after you arrived at work that
someone had made a telephone call in connection with the movement of Oswald,
threatening Oswald's life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes; did I learn of a telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I heard Captain Frazier, I believe it was, talking to Captain
Talbert, and in my presence, and several others. I don't remember which ones,
sergeants and a lieutenant or so, that I believe it was Sheriff Decker called
during the night and asked that Oswald be moved during the night sometime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did this conversation take place; how soon after you
came to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. It was some time&mdash;probably it would have been a little before
7 o'clock, because we meet downstairs at 7 o'clock sharp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. In the detail room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So this would have been almost within a few minutes of the
time that you had walked in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, were Talbert and Frazier&mdash;and who else was present during
the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I believe Lieutenant Pierce was there, myself and Sergeant Putnam
might have been there. Several other sergeants. See, this is the change time
and all of his supervisors, Captain Frazier's and Captain Talbert's, the ones
that are working that day, they will generally be in the office at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you tell me where we were?</p>

<p>(The record was here read by the reporter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any other things that were said? Try to
think about what these people said when this topic was brought up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Captain Frazier said something to the effect that he had called Captain
Fritz when Sheriff Decker called to request the movement of Oswald, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
Captain Fritz stated that he didn't think that Chief Curry wanted him moved
during the night, that it was&mdash;he would be moved some time this day, that day,
rather than in the night. It would be this day. That's where I got it that he
was to be moved on the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I take it that this was sort of changing of the guard at
this point, and Frazier was going off duty and he was sort of passing on the
word to Talbert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did Talbert say in response to that information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I don't remember. The thing that I got, or impression that I got,
was that they were just waiting for Chief Curry to say to move him, until they
had proper authorization to move him, from our department rather than from
the sheriff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Rio Pierce present at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I think that he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And it is my understanding of this situation that you had there
at that time is Captain Talbert, Lieutenant Pierce and the sergeants that were
all under them, kind of a general briefing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did Talbert then discuss this matter with you people who
were on his shift?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Not at this time. We went back downstairs to the basement to
the whole detail. This is to assign the patrolmen out on their tour of duty, to
brief them of the new orders, if there had been any, and generally to get the
men out in the field in the squad cars. This happens at 7 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you send all the men out that you normally would
send out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; with some few that we would use, the ones of which I
can't recall. I imagine it would have been equivalent to three or four men
that we would have kept in the city hall itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At that time did you have any thought of how you would assemble
the necessary men to handle the transfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after you had this initial meeting with Talbert, what did
you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Now, you are referring to after the detail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After you assigned these men, and what you called the general
orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. We went back to the second floor, back to Captain Talbert's office,
which is the general offices for the patrol division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What happened up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, I don't remember anything specific until about&mdash;I, myself,
went to the third floor to familiarize myself with the happenings, about the
news cameramen and just to get an idea of what was going on and who was
to be present, such as that, because I had been off. This was my first day back
since&mdash;in a week, in fact. I had been on a few days vacation to go hunting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time you went up to the third floor, did you have any
idea as to what your general responsibilities were going to be for the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think I am misleading you. First of all, you have some general
responsibility, standard responsibilities that you have every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What are those particular responsibilities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, I am assigned to a zone area that has a group of 6 squads
that work for me, equivalent to 15 men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What zone is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No. 110. It's in the eastern portion of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that the Love Field area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; this is the&mdash;Love Field area is north Dallas. I am in
the eastern portion of Dallas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. And do you normally handle most of your duties from
right within the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir: I have various paperwork to do in the office at times.
Generally I am out in the car, answering calls with the squads, or when they
need advice, supervision, well, I generally answer their calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, when you met with Talbert the second time
upon the second floor, did you have any idea at that time that your duties
would be any different on Sunday than they were on any other date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I assumed that I would probably confine myself to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to make that assumption?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, because of my seniority. It was just assumed that they
would want me there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, so you went up to the third floor then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And who did you talk to and who did you see up there on the
third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No one in particular. I just went up to see what was going on
on the third floor. This is the first time I had been to the third floor. There
were numerous cameras there, lot of cables. Just as you get off the elevator
there was a lot of cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time would you estimate that you were up on the third
floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Probably 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go up to the third floor again during the morning; that
is between that time and the time that Oswald was shot, did you have occasion
to go back to the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I believe I did, but for no specific purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, if you can separate out the different times that you might
have been up there, I want to know as best you recall whether there were news
people up there on the third floor when you went up this first time, around&mdash;what
did you say, 8 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes. Were there news people up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see newspaper people up there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether the TV cameras were manned at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether these people seemed to be operating the
cameras, shooting footage or did they seem to be in any sort of operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. They did have a monitor, small monitor set that they had the cameras
on. However, they weren't broadcasting at the time. They might have
been taping. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see any other people that you thought were newsmen
up there, other than those manning the cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir. Pressmen. Newspaper people, none of which I can
recall that I knew myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What's your best estimate of the number of news people that
were up there at about 8 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Twenty-five, possibly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did this create to you what appeared to be a crowded condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how long did you remain up there on the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Oh, maybe 10 or 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you recall if you went into the homicide bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Sometime during that morning I did step into the homicide bureau.
However, I don't know who I talked to. And then there wasn't any specific
reason that I did go in there. I just stepped in. The hall was very crowded.
It might have been just that I was close to the homicide office and I stepped in
there to get out of the crowd, because it was the least congested. There were
no newsmen or pressmen in there, no cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you able to tell, when you were up there at about 8 o'clock,
what the general impression seemed to be as to when Oswald would be moved?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The impression I got, there was anticipation from the newsmen
that&mdash;and the hopes of the newsmen, that he would probably be moved that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But as to how early in the day, did you get any idea of what
they were thinking of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir. This was at anytime. This was the impression I got, at
anytime he could be moved. They were ready to start shooting, or go live
television, I am sure, at anytime, at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they ask you any particular questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. None specific; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they attempt to approach you or shout things at you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any other bureaus you went in on the third
floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, where did you go from the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Went back down to the second floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And who did you see down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Captain Talbert, Lieutenant Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any conversation you had with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, general conversation that morning was when possibly Oswald
might be moved. Of course, I was waiting for instructions as to what to do
when he was moved. I received my first instructions about 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you receive those instructions from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. From Lieutenant Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you know who Lieutenant Pierce received his instructions
from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did Pierce tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. His instructions were for me to take a group of men and&mdash;or
whatever men I needed, and thoroughly search the garage portion of the basement,
to vacate it and then thoroughly search it. <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you&mdash;go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I took about 13 reserve officers that were waiting in the assembly
room, which is on the ground floor, the basement floor, along with Sergeant
Putnam, Officer L.&nbsp;E. Jez, and A.&nbsp;R. Brock, and these 13 reserves that were in
the detail room at that time, names of which I don't know. They were commanded
by Captain Arnett. I do know this. And Captain Arnett assisted in the
search, too. We vacated the basement of all people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Are you talking about just the garage area or the
entire basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The garage area. And I assigned Officer R.&nbsp;E. Vaughn to the
entrance ramp, which is entering on Main Street, Officer R.&nbsp;C. Nelson to the
doorway coming from the police and court building and into the basement, and
Officer B.&nbsp;G. Patterson the Commerce Street ramp, which is the exit, and I
assigned one reserve officer to the southern portion of the basement, to the stairways
that lead into the subbasement or the machine room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, the regular officers that you assigned were Vaughn, Nelson,
and Patterson, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were any of those men members of your platoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; all of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did they happen to be in the building at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I believe they were the officers that we retained that morning to
assist us for whatever might have to be done in the morning, or during the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they normally have assignments in patrol cars some place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; all of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who made the decision to keep those men in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I would imagine Lieutenant Pierce. To retain them at city hall
during the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I imagine Lieutenant Pierce did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can I ask you directly, you did not, if I understand correctly,
you did not make that decision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. To retain them at the city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; they were there and I utilized them for this purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were there other people who were retained at city hall
besides those three men in the platoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. There were other men that were called back in from patrol duty
to supplement what men we had at the central headquarters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But these were the only three men who actually stayed back
and never went out to the field at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any particular reason that you can think of why those three
men should have been kept there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; other than just assignment, routine assignment. I mean
it could have been someone else as well as it was them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you assigned reserve officers&mdash;somebody, <span class="locked">rather&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. To the southern portion of the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did you put a guard on that door, or in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. For security reasons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any reason to think that it would be possible to
get through from the subbasement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, I knew that there were doors going into the subbasement
from&mdash;however, I checked them and they were locked, but still there was a
possibility, since you did have doors there, or ingress from the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know where the ingress from the street to the subbasement
is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; as you enter on Commerce Street, going down into the
basement, there is a door on the southern side of the&mdash;just before you go into
the main part of the basement, that leads down. It's the porters' quarters, that
leads down to the porters' quarters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there any other entrance into that subbasement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The elevators in the new city hall is the only ones that you can
get in, is the only place, other than the ramp&mdash;we had all places covered. In
fact, I <span class="locked">assigned&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No. I am talking about the subbasement now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The garage portion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; there is no other place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Other than that door that comes into Commerce Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; well, there is a door that was locked, another door that's
used as a&mdash;oh, I think they sometimes throw materials&mdash;it's not even an elevator.
It appears to be an elevator door, if you open it up, it's a straight drop into the
subbasement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I had the maintenance man open this door for me. He did and I
could see that you couldn't&mdash;or it would be hard for a man to climb up a straight
wall to open these doors. You couldn't open them from the inside or the subbasement
side of the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you have a clear recollection as to whether or not
any TV or radio or other wires came through the subbasement door up to the
basement area in the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. There were none coming out. From the subbasement into the
garage area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. There were not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any TV or radio or other wires coming into the
garage area other than through the ramps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you give these people you stationed in the garage area,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
Nelson and the reserve officer and&mdash;who was it that you stationed&mdash;did you
station somebody by the elevators at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; Brock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Those three men, did you give them any specific instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were those instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That they were to let no one in other than&mdash;well, first that they
were to let no one in until we had completely searched the basement, and then
that we would notify them after we had completed the search, and then they
were to let no one in except authorized pressmen, properly identified pressmen,
newsmen, or policemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have some reason to think that those people might be
coming through the entranceways that they were guarding?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Did I have some reason to think this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. It was strictly security. I was doing exactly what my orders
were, to keep all people out. As far as any reason other than strictly security;
no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am suggesting, really, is that you could have given
them a blanket order, "Don't let anybody in there"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any reason why you didn't give them that blanket order? Off
the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were we?</p>

<p>(The record was here read by the reporter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. To just let no one in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, just a moment. Let me&mdash;I knew that the pressmen&mdash;I
am wondering where I&mdash;it was just generally assumed to me that the pressmen
would be allowed to witness the movement of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But from these doors, now, the men that were on the ramps,
of course, you would expect an influxion of people down those ramps, but from
those interior doors in the garage, I am wondering what expectation you could
have that anybody would be coming through there? I am not asking this question
to try to trip you up or anything like that, but I am just wondering if you
thought about this? You might think of something that you had in mind that
might shed some light on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; the only thing, I was searching the basement and to do
this I had to clear the basement to satisfy myself that there was no one in
the basement, and after I was satisfied with this, then the press and the police
officers could come back in the basement, if they were properly identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you instructed Nelson and Brock and the reserve
officer, were Vaughn and Patterson also present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of course, they were guarding the ramps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Right. Patterson, Vaughn were guarding the ramps, and that
was my instructions to them, to keep everyone out until we had completed
the search. Then after we had completed the search, to let no one in other
than properly identified pressmen or policemen, and to not to leave those
assignments unless they were relieved by myself or Sergeant Putnam.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, can you give us some idea of how many cars there were in
the garage at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Some, I would say 25 or 30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were these cars eventually moved out at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; some few of them were district squad cars that had
come in with prisoners, and then, of course, they left, but as a mass movement
to move the cars out, we didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who checked the stairway door in the garage that leads up
into the municipal building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The stairway door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I don't know of any door that leads up into the&mdash;the stairway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a <span class="locked">stairway&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That goes down into the subbasement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well now, over where the elevators <span class="locked">are&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Oh. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You know what I am talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who checked that door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Sergeant Putnam checked it once and I checked it once and it
was locked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know at the time you checked it that even though the
door was locked from the outside, it could be opened from the inside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. [No response.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me state this again. Even though the door would be locked
from the garage side, that from the stairway side it would be unlocked; were
you aware of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I believe we asked the maintenance man about this, and I believe
he locked it so as it couldn't be unlocked from either side unless they had a key.
I believe Sergeant Putnam called this to the maintenance man's attention,
and I recall being there at the time they were discussing it, and I think at that
time the maintenance man locked the door so it couldn't be unlocked from
either side other than with a key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall the name of this maintenance man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; I don't know. I didn't know his name to start with.
However, I did know he was the maintenance man, by sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you get ahold of this maintenance man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Sergeant Putnam, I believe, had gotten&mdash;or had thought about
this and asked him, or he had gotten in touch with him some way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this at the same time you had the 13 men in the garage
searching, or at some later time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. This was during the search.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you know where this maintenance man was <span class="locked">located&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Putnam found him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I don't. I do know I sent for him one time, or had an officer
to go page the maintenance man to meet me, to have him unlock this door in
question, that I thought&mdash;or I wanted it opened so I could see in it, to see if
it was a service elevator or what. I had never seen that door opened before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you make any inquiries about the passenger elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Coming into the garage portion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes; they were operating at the time. I think there were two
colored boys that were operating the elevators, and we told them not to come
down to the basement for any reason. And we posted Brock there at the
elevators.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, so that we understand what we are talking about, my
recollection is that there is another elevator that's a service elevator also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir. This was the one that was operating, primarily, that
morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think we can help things out here somewhat. This is a diagram
of the basement area, and I am going to mark this "Dallas, Tex., Sergeant
Dean, March 24, 1964, Exhibit 5007."</p>

<p>Now, making reference, Sergeant, to this particular diagram here, at the
time you searched the garage, it is my understanding that what's marked on
here as elevators Nos. 1 and 2 were operable, that there were some colored
boys in there, or somebody who was operating those elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No. I believe those were not in operation, Nos. 1 and 2. The
service elevator was, I do know. There was the parking attendant, a colored
boy, and he sits here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't you put a mark on that diagram there, make it an
X?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right [indicating].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you want to label that parking attendant, or whatever
you think is appropriate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right [indicating], this is a colored boy that usually sits
here. He has a bench there he sits on until he is needed. We made him
leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Made him leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. In fact, I think he was relieved from duty that day, because I
took him out of the Commerce Street ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And was there somebody operating that service elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The service elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many people were in that service elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. There was one. When I said two persons I was thinking of the
elevator operator, which is also a colored boy, and the parking attendant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you want to just put an X on the service elevator, to indicate
there was somebody in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right, sir [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you want to place a mark at approximately the place
that you stationed the men who were guarding the entrance to the subbasement,
this reserve officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Oh, the subbasement. Let me see&mdash;[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me explain this diagram to you. This is the basement,
this dotted line here is the upstairs [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Oh, I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This actually goes under the sidewalk here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. This is where the reserve officer was [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, where did you station Brock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Put him in a position that he could see this door here and also
these three elevators [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, who else did you station in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No one&mdash;well, Nelson was&mdash;let's see, Nelson was here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And where did you place Vaughn and where did you place
Patterson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Is this the exit proper, door, here to the&mdash;[indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. This would be the top of the ramp here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, you want to sign this down here and mark
on there the time, sign it there and then in the middle of the diagram, so it
doesn't confuse things here, put the&mdash;well, sign it over under here. If we put
time in here, somebody may think that was the time that you made the mark
on here. Then if you would label this status of basement, whenever it was
that&mdash;[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. During the search?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. [Indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Very good. Now, you have marked on here approximately
9:15 to 9:30 a.m. I am not going to ask you what you found there
and so forth, because you have made a full statement on it. We know, for
example, you found a rifle in the back of one of the police cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after the search was completed, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The pressmen were allowed to come back in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this, where had they been removed to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Into the police court building, or the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. By the records room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. And they were allowed back in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your best estimate of the number of policemen that
came back into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, of course, it increased as the time went on, so it would be
hard <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many newspapermen did you have to clear out of the
basement at 9:15, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Oh, approximately 15 or 20, maybe 25.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you went down into the basement, before the search,
were there any TV cameras down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; I believe there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you want to indicate on the map here where it is that you
think the TV cameras, or camera was placed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if there was a TV camera at this location [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I believe there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I am referring, so that the record will reflect this, to a TV
camera that's in the entranceway from the ramp, towards the jail office, and it's
on the Commerce Street wall, along the Commerce Street wall. Did you move
that TV camera at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir. Moved the operators away from it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do after that, after you completed the search
and let the people back into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Let me think. I believe I stayed in the basement area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time that you completed the search, had you heard anything
about the time that Oswald would be moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you heard anything about the route that he would be moved
by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. At the <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That you completed the search?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes. About, somewhere around 9:45, Captain Talbert sent me a
group of regular officers that had been called in off of patrol district.
[Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, can I help you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. My report [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I didn't have in my original report, I do have in my original notes
in my locker, as to some traffic assignments that I made. This was about 9:45.
These men were sent to me by Captain Talbert. I briefed them about here in
the basement, away from everyone, to let no one know the route. This is when
Captain Talbert advised me that the route would be to leave the Commerce
Street side, go to the expressway, north to Main [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that Pearl Expressway or Central Expressway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Central Expressway. And then west on Main to the county courthouse,
or the sheriff's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me try to refresh your recollection a little bit here. Up to
this point had you heard anything about a proposed route that would have gone
from Central Expressway and turned at Elm Street, rather than Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I was thinking it was&mdash;I knew that they changed it, after I made
my assignment I had to change them again, because they said they wasn't going
to use it. It was either Main Street that they weren't going to use, they were
going to Commerce&mdash;however, I think you are right. I think originally my assignments
were made at the intersections&mdash;not Commerce, but Elm, and then
they changed the&mdash;they being Captain Talbert, and told me that they would not
use Elm, that they would use Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you draw a big circle in this area where you instructed
these men, to show roughly what area the men covered, and would you put an
appropriate note on there as to what happened and what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how many men did you give instructions to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. 13, 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't you just put that number there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did those men then take police vehicles and go to their
appointed spots?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir. Immediately to their squad cars that had been parked
outside and then&mdash;they reported into the basement to me for these assignments,
they went immediately to these assignments, and these assignments were made
at various intersections along the proposed route that Oswald would be
transferred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was Brock in the basement at the time that you gave that
assignment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir. However, he was still at the elevators then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Patterson and Vaughn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. They were at their stations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After you made those assignments, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I moved back to the area, when you come out of the jail office, to
the ramp, and this is when Lieutenant Pierce came up to me and appeared to be
in a hurry&mdash;well now, the armored car had already backed into the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. How much <span class="locked">before&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. This armored car had backed into the ramp as I was standing here
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let's place these times a little bit. How long was it between
the time that you instructed these 13 to 15 men to go on their posts and the time
that the armored car arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Oh, 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't put down here where you made that note, about 10
minutes before armored car arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Now, how much time elapsed between the time you made
assignment to these men and the time that you searched the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Right. Why don't you put down here then 15 or 20 minutes
before assignment to Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, I understand about the time that the armored
car arrived, or was it shortly after the armored car arrived, you had a conversation
with Lieutenant Pierce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much after the armored car arrived would you say that
conversation occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Five minutes after the armored car arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We don't need to mark that. And this conversation with
Lieutenant Pierce occurred in the entranceway, off the Main Street ramp toward
the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was anybody else there when you talked with Pierce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. There were several people around, but they didn't hear his instructions
to me, I am sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. What did Pierce tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. He said for me to go to the armored car, to the rear of the armored
car, and to get him two men to go with him, and he said, "Now." Sergeant
Putnam was maybe 15 or 20 feet from me, and I instructed him to get an unassigned
man immediately and to go with Lieutenant Pierce, and Lieutenant
Pierce, by this time, of course, he was going to get his car, or walking over
to his car. Sergeant Putnam got&mdash;told Sergeant Maxey to go with him,
and those three got into Lieutenant Pierce's car with Lieutenant Pierce driving,
and I went to the rear of the armored car that had backed in, which was some,
I guess 30 feet, 30 to 35 feet from where the shooting was. This armored car
backed down, and I imagine it would probably be around 30 to 35 feet. As
soon as I got to the armored car I turned around and looked back, and this
is when I saw Lieutenant Pierce in this plain black car trying to get past the
newsmen and to go out the wrong way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Up the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is my understanding correct that from the time that
you placed your guards in the basement and then began the search, until
Pierce's car drove up the ramp, you did not leave the basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as you saw Pierce's car go out of the&mdash;move out of
the garage area, who was in that car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Sergeant Maxey and Sergeant Putnam, Lieutenant Pierce was
driving it. I do recall that Sergeant Putnam had to get out of the car and
tell some people to move out of the way so they could drive out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, where did he get out of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Just as they were turning from the basement to go up the ramp,
about this location [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see him get back in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you see him get back in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Same place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So when he drove through this next line of newsmen, when the
car went through this next line of newsmen, is it your recollection that Sergeant
Putnam was back in the car, or did he follow the car up ahead and clear
these others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I believe he walked on up for a few steps, not too far, and then
when he did see that the way was clear he got into the car then, but he did
get out of the car to clear the way for the car to move out of the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Now, did you watch him go out of the ramp up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you see what he did when he got to the top of the
ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I couldn't see to the top of the ramp. It's obscured, from where
I was. I was halfway up this ramp and I couldn't see to the top of the
ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you watch him, though, go up until you lost sight of
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, during the period that you were looking toward Putnam's
car, were you able to see the people behind the car in this particular&mdash;across
the Main Street ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Just as a group. I mean as a group of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see anybody in that group that you recognized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see any police officers that you recognized there, other
than Putnam?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. None that I paid any attention to. I mean if I had noticed them
I could have probably seen someone that I recognized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Now, of course, you have known Jack Ruby for 4 or
5 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I have known Jack Ruby since, I believe 19&mdash;the early part of 1960
or the early part of 1961. It was the time that I came downtown from Oak Cliff,
as a sergeant. I met him. Now, the record, or your report from the FBI
says that I had known him since 1959, which is erroneous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. We will do that at the end of the deposition, because I
want to get that straightened out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you knew Ruby well enough so that you would recognize
him on sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you see Ruby in that area there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after you lost sight of Pierce's car going up the ramp,
what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, my attention was focused to this point, because this was
a tense time, and I was, of course, watching the exit here from the jail office
[indicating].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you watch how the security developed along in here;
what the officers did to maintain security along here [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I knew that they had just lined up. However, I didn't pay any
attention particularly to this at the time. I knew that Oswald was, in all
probability, going to be brought out pretty soon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you looked toward the Main Street ramp and saw the newsmen
re-form along there, can you recall how deep this line of newsmen was?
Do you understand what I mean by how deep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. You mean lengthwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. It was probably going to about somewhere along here. They were
all trying to be within view of the&mdash;&mdash;[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there just a single line along there or were there four of five
or six different lines; you know, four or five behind each other, or how many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I know there was a double line and possibly some were standing
behind them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, had you given any instructions prior to the time that
Rio Pierce's car went up the ramp, to any men as to how to maintain security
along this line of newsmen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; I hadn't. The majority of those, I think, were detectives
or plainclothesmen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know if anybody had responsibility for giving instructions
to that group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. To my knowledge, I don't know of anyone. I am sure that they
did, but I don't know who did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you receive instructions from anybody concerning how to
maintain security along the path from the jail office door to the car that Oswald
would be loaded into?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; at one time I know that there were several cameras set
up in this area, and Chief Batchelor told them that they would have to leave this
area and move to the basement area. I was present during Chief Batchelor's&mdash;or
when he told these TV men to move out of that area, inside the jail office,
<span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. TV cameras inside the jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; and lights set up. This was, I believe, before the search
or shortly after the search. I am thinking it was shortly after the search, that
these men were told to move out of this area and move their cameras and equipment
out into the garage portion of the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, sergeant, did there come a time when you learned that the
route was being changed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The route to the sheriff's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. This was&mdash;I believe I received both of those instructions when I
assigned those men. I had already assigned&mdash;well, I do know that I had already
assigned all these men along this traffic route, and then it had been changed.
Captain Talbert said, "No; they are not going to use Main Street&mdash;or Elm Street.
They are going to use Main," I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you learn this after you had already sent the men out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, is there anything that makes you sure about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Because I reassigned them, at the same time I briefed them, and
made these other assignments. I learned that the route had been changed, and
I reassigned them, at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you assign a man to the corner of Main and Pearl
Expressway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes; I know that I did, but I can't recall who it was. I have that
information in my locker, my original assignments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it you have a lot of notes in your locker, or you have some
notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; at a later time I will bring those to you, if you like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I would very much appreciate it. Do you want to make a note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
of that? If you send them over to us tomorrow, I would appreciate that very
much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Tomorrow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; and we don't need the originals if you want <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No; you can have them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, what did you do after you saw Pierce's car
go up the ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I stood at the rear of the armored car and watched&mdash;my attention
was focused to this point here, to the exit from the jail office, or the corridor
here. I noticed that these two plain cars had pulled up behind, or in my same
direction, and I assumed that these two cars would be loaded with officers that
would follow the armored car. However, they hadn't loaded. They were
pulling into position here and had gotten into position when all the confusion
started [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me interrupt your train of thought here. In looking at this
map, it occurs to me that we don't have Nelson marked on this map [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Nelson is here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Oh, okay; now, do you know if Brock was pulled off this station
at anytime prior to the shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; he was told to stay there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you don't know of your own <span class="locked">knowledge&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Whether he was there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, as the two police cars moved into position on
the Commerce Street ramp behind the armored car, what happened, what did you
see happen and what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I heard someone say, "Here he comes, they are bringing him out."
Of course, you could hear voices, loud voices, or excitement, and then I saw
a man just dart in&mdash;this was during all the confusion, before the shooting, but
I do recall seeing a man dart out. I couldn't tell who he was. It was that
fast [witness snaps fingers].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did he seem to dart from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. From the rail over here. The side&mdash;just dart out from a group
of people that were standing against the rail facing the exit [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Can you mark there with an "X" and a circle around
it, approximately where he was and how close he was to this railing? Do you
think he was right on the railing or [indicating]&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, the railing&mdash;you have a curb there and then I don't recall how
wide that curb is, but the railing, you can lean against standing on the ramp
itself [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; how far would you say he was from that railing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I would say he was up against the railing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is that the man that shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't you put a circle and an "X" down there and write
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, where was "Blackie" Harrison standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I didn't recognize&mdash;or didn't notice "Blackie" Harrison. I do
recall now and I know where he was standing, next to him, from films I have
seen since then. However, I didn't even know he was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as I understand from your statement, and interrupt me
if I am incorrect, when you saw Ruby shoot Oswald, you moved toward the
struggle and then Ruby was taken into the jail office, and did you follow
them on in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir. I ran immediately, jumped over these cars, or one of
them, jumped over the hood of it, over the top of it, and they were dragging&mdash;Ruby
and several detectives that were subduing him were about at the door,
or [indicating]&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I had just as soon not have you mark at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Okay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I understand why you want to, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear, between the time that you saw Ruby move toward
Oswald and the time that you reached him, did you hear anything said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do when you reached Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, I ran to assist, whatever I could do, or assist the officers,
not knowing exactly what had happened&mdash;or I knew that there had been a
shooting. However, they had enough men that were subduing him, and I asked
the question, when they had him on the floor inside the jail office, "Who in
the world is it?" <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Couldn't you tell by looking at him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No; at the time I couldn't see him because there were so many
over him. And they were&mdash;well, his face was hidden from me by the amount
of officers that were around him. I said, "Who in the world is it?" And
evidently I was talking loud over all the other voices, and evidently Ruby heard
me and said, "I am Jack Ruby. You all know me."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how long did you remain with Jack Ruby there in the
jail office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I immediately walked around to where Oswald was laying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how long did you remain there where Oswald was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Oh, maybe&mdash;less than a minute. I saw that the doctor&mdash;there
was an emergency doctor working on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you go from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I went back out to the basement, out to where the shooting
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I was trying to keep all the people in. I heard Captain Talbert say,
"Don't let anyone out." And I was echoing his instructions to the men on the
ramp, to not let anyone in or out, no one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did there come a time while you were down there in the
basement that you were interviewed by TV men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; that was after I had&mdash;just some few minutes, I don't
know, that several newsmen had&mdash;or did interview me, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember which TV station that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Tom Pettit is with NBC, I believe. I did know one of the local
men, Bob Huffaker. He is with KRLD-TV. But there were several. I don't
<span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, there was also a time, undoubtedly, that you
were interviewed, or somebody quoted you in the newspapers, and there was
a great to-do about this, as I understand, in the police department. Somebody
<span class="locked">claimed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Misquoted me, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was that at this particular TV interview; was that when
you made the statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The newspaper article that appeared, the news or the writer of
that story told me that he wrote that story from my initial interview that was
given shortly after the shooting, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall talking with that man down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The man that wrote <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir. I wouldn't know him by sight now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall ever seeing that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after you had this TV interview, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I went to the third floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And where did you go on the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Just as I got off of the elevator Chief Curry approached me, along
with another man. He introduced him very quickly as Forrest V. Sorrels, with
the Secret Service, or head of the Secret Service here in Dallas, gave me his
keys to the outer door that has&mdash;or access to the jail elevator, told me to take
Mr. Sorrels to the fifth floor to talk to Ruby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, between the time that you left the jail <span class="locked">office&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you went into the basement area and had the TV interview
and then went up to the third floor, did you talk with any of the police officers
who had been down there in the basement area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were in the jail office, before you came out, did you
talk to any of the officers who were there, who were in the jail office; did you
talk with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, why were you going up to the third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I was going to Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what were you going to do up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I was just going to see if Jack Ruby was in Captain Fritz' office,
or whether he was taken immediately to the jail. I didn't know where he was
taken to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did you want to go up to see Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. To see if they were&mdash;this was in my mind, to see if they were going
to go ahead and identify him, because I knew other pressmen and other people
were going to be asking me, since I had this interview, and see if&mdash;did he want
me to go ahead and identify him or do what I did in the initial interview, say
that this information will have to come from Captain Fritz' office. It really
wasn't significant. I knew that I would be talked to at later times all during
the day and pressed for the identity of this man, and I wanted to ask them
there did they want us to release it or want them to keep it and release it
themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You had already told the newsmen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir. I had already told the newsmen this. I didn't identify
the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You had already told the newsmen that the man who shot Oswald
was Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir. I didn't. I didn't identify the man. They asked me did
I recognize this man. I said "Yes." And they asked me could I tell them who
he was, and I said I had rather not, and I did not identify him as Ruby. I
identified him as a businessman in the city of Dallas, but I did tell them that
I recognized the man by sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you got up on the third floor, where did you see
Chief Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Just as I got off of the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you ask him to discuss this problem with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir. He immediately introduced&mdash;said, "This is Mr. Forrest V.
Sorrels, head of the Secret Service in Dallas, and take my keys and take him
to the fifth floor to interview Ruby."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You got up to the fifth floor, who was with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Detective Archer, D.&nbsp;R. Archer, Detective T.&nbsp;D. McMillon and
Detective B.&nbsp;S. Clardy is the three, and that's the only three I can recall
standing there. I think that was all that was with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there a jailer there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Not standing there necessarily by him. There, of course, are
jailers all over the floor, and you know, there were&mdash;not particularly around
him though. The only ones I can recall standing close to Ruby was those
three detectives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What state of dress or undress was Ruby in at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. He was stripped to his shorts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do when you got up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I walked immediately to him. I heard&mdash;well, immediately I told
him, I said, "This is Mr. Forrest V. Sorrels"&mdash;started the introduction, and
Ruby stopped me and he said, "I know who he is. He is with the FBI." Mr.
Sorrels then informed him. He said, "No. I am not with the FBI. I am
with the Secret Service." And then he again told him, "I want you to know
that I am not with the FBI. I am with the Secret Service." And so Ruby said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
something to the effect, "Well, I knew that you were working for the Government."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember Ruby making any remark to Sorrels to the
effect, "Are you with the newspapermen"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir. I recall most all of that conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us what that conversation was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. After Sorrels had identified himself as a Secret Service man, he
said, "I want to ask you some questions." And then Ruby asked him, "Is this
for the magazines or press?" And he said, "No. It's for my information, as an
agent." And he said, "Okay. I will answer all your questions."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any discussion with him, anything Sorrels
said about his acquaintanceship in the Jewish community?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Sorrels asked him first, I <span class="locked">believe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No. I am not making myself clear. I am sorry. Did Sorrels
say anything to Ruby about Sorrels' acquaintanceship among the Jewish merchants,
that you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No. I don't&mdash;seems like he said something, that he had&mdash;that he
knew some Jewish&mdash;I don't recall exactly what, but relative to what you are
asking, he did say something about he was acquainted with some person that
was a Jew, something to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you acquainted with the name of a guy named Honest Joe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Right. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us what you remember about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, he said, "Well, I know Honest Joe or"&mdash;In other words,
the only thing that I got out of that was that he knew Honest Joe. This wasn't
relative to what I wanted to find out from Ruby, and I just disregarded this
from my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did this take place inside the jail cell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir. He was in the hallway or the corridor outside a jail cell.
He hadn't been placed in a cell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were Archer, Clardy, and McMillon around during this
conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir. I think they stood there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how long would you say that Sorrels talked with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Oh, 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you remember anything that Sorrels learned from
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us what that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes. He asked him what possessed him to do it. Of course, I
have testified to all this in court. And he said that he was&mdash;had been despondent
over the assassination of the President, also Officer Tippit, and that he
was a very emotional man, and that out of grief for both these people, was one
of the motivations, and that he couldn't see any reason for a long and lengthy
trial, even though he believed in due process of law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he talk with Sorrels at all at that time about how he got
into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir. I asked him&mdash;Sorrels didn't ask any questions relative
to that. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long after Sorrels finished talking with Ruby did you ask
that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Immediately. After Mr. Sorrels said, "Okay. Thank you." And
I don't recall whether Mr. Sorrels stayed there or whether he walked off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who else was present when you asked Ruby that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I think McMillon and them were still there. I just really didn't&mdash;I
knew that I wasn't by myself with him. I knew that there was someone there
and I believe it was McMillon and Archer that had stayed there. I am not
sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What else did you talk with Ruby about, after Sorrels finished
talking to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. After Sorrels finished, I said, "Ruby, I want to ask you a couple
of questions myself." And he said, "All right." I said, "How did you get in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
basement?" And he said, "I walked in the Main Street ramp." And he told me,
he said, "I have just been to the Western Union to mail a money order to Fort
Worth." And he said, "I walked from the Western Union to the ramp." And
he said, "I saw Sam Pierce&mdash;" and he referred to him as Sam Pierce&mdash;"drive
out of the basement. At that time, at the time the car drove out is when I
walked in."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there a Sam Pierce on the force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir. He is a lieutenant. He is here tonight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. His name is also Rio Pierce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Lt. Rio S. Pierce, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does he go by the name Sam?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does he also go by the name Rio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is one <span class="locked">used&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Just as much as the other. Depends on who met him under which
name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, what else did he talk to you about at that particular
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. After he answered that question, I said, "How long had you been in
the basement when Oswald came into your view?" And he said, "I just walked
in. I just walked to the bottom of the ramp when he came out."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What else did you talk to him about at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That's all. I heard all of Sorrels' questions and I heard all of
Ruby's answers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as far as the questioning of Sorrels is concerned, did you
testify to that at the Ruby trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after you finished this conversation with Ruby about how
he got down into the basement, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Caught the elevator back down to the basement and got my gun that
had been taken there by a patrolman. If I am not mistaken, I rode down on the
same elevator with Mr. Sorrels, and then I went back up to the third floor to
Chief Curry's office and took him his keys that he had given me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were the keys to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. They were&mdash;well, it was a keyring with a lot of keys on it, but he
had given me these to gain entrance to the door that's always locked on the
third floor of the jail elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then how long did you stay down there with Chief Curry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Just long enough to give him his keys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you go after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. [No response.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go back to homicide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No; I didn't go back to homicide. I don't remember whether I
went back to the basement&mdash;I believe that I did, went back to the basement to
see how things were down there. And, of course, a great number of people had
left the basement, and I assume were en route or were going to the Parkland
Hospital to check on&mdash;since the focal point had gone to Parkland Hospital, I
assumed that's where all these people had gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you tell Chief Curry what Ruby had told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. At that time; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do, now, after you went down to the first floor,
the basement, you say; what did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, I don't remember exactly what I did. I did go to Parkland
Hospital and I got there before Oswald was pronounced dead, which I think was
at 1:07, wasn't it? Somewhere around 1 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes; anyhow, I stayed at Parkland Hospital <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you see out at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, I talked to Lee Harvey Oswald's mother, and in fact, I had
taken her along with some&mdash;I assumed some Secret Service men, I assumed they
were Secret Service men that were with her when I started talking to her. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
went in with her into view the body, her and Marina Oswald, to view the body
of Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did somebody assign you to go out to Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to go out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. To check on the condition of Oswald. I knew that&mdash;well, it was
just reaction for me to go out there, because I knew that I would probably be
needed out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you check in with Captain Talbert before you went out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; I did check out with the dispatcher on the radio, that I
was en route to Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Lieutenant Pierce, did you check out with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I think when I got to Parkland Hospital I called him and advised
him that I would be at Parkland until I notified him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got out to Parkland Hospital and before you saw Mrs.
Oswald, Marguerite Oswald, did you talk with any police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. At Parkland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, I am sure that I talked to some. Nothing specific or no orders
given, no assignments or anything. I was, more than anything, I was answering
questions as to what happened in the basement, from everyone, even policemen
and everyone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you tell them about the conversation you had with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I just didn't tell anyone about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, where did you find Marguerite Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. She was waiting in a room just out of the emergency room there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what Secret Service agents were with her at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you wait with Marguerite in that room with the Secret
Service agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No. That's&mdash;shortly after I went in to where Marguerite and
Marina were, Marguerite wanted to see the body, and they tried to explain to
her that they really hadn't gotten him in shape to view yet. He just came out
of the operating room, and she said, well, she wanted to see him then, and she
more or less was directing her statements and demands to me, since I was
the only uniformed officer there, and said that she would like to go in and
see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did you happen to go to Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, I was just standing outside the door there where they said
he was, and someone had pointed her out, and said that's the mother and the
wife. No particular reason. But I did, after she asked to go in and see him,
they said&mdash;the doctor said it would be all right for them, and I did go in with
them, when they went in to view the body. During the time that we were
in this room where Oswald's body was Mrs. Oswald, the mother, turned to me
and said that at this time she wanted to make a statement to me in regard
to the allegations against her son, that she could&mdash;something to the effect that
she could prove that they were wrong, and about this time she was interrupted
by one of the nurses telling me that I was wanted on the phone. So I left
and didn't <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who had called you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Lieutenant Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. He was at central headquarters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he have to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. He asked me how long I thought I was going to be there and I
said, well, I was leaving now. And then I left and came back to the city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you talked to Pierce on the telephone, did you tell
him about your conversation with Ruby?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you drove out to Parkland Hospital, did you drive out
alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you drove back, did you drive back with anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; by myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what did you do when you got back to central police
headquarters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I went to our office on the second floor, the patrol captain's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And who was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, I don't recall exactly. I know this was again getting close
to the change time. It was somewhere around 2 o'clock, and the secretary
told me that I had several phone calls waiting on me, and one of&mdash;well, there
were some long distance calls that had seen me on television, and I didn't
answer all of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any phone calls from anybody you knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No; my wife had called. I mean there had just been a lot of
people calling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you make any phone calls when you got that message
that you had calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; at the time, about&mdash;the only phone call that I had taken
was the dispatcher called and&mdash;just about the time I walked in, and said that
I had a long distance call from&mdash;oh, Chicago or somewhere, and they transferred
it down there, and, of course, they were asking who this man was, how did
he get in, questions that newsmen&mdash;it was from some radio station. I <span class="locked">didn't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In Chicago. And did you tell them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then what did you do after that long distance telephone call
from Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, there was newsmen from KLIF came into the office, asked
would I give him a short interview, which I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who were those people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. This man, it was Glen Duncan. I didn't know him before. I
hadn't seen him before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anybody else that you remember with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; he was by himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And was that a tape-recorded interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; station KLIF.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how long did that interview last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Gosh, I don't know. Maybe 4 or 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever get a copy of that interview from them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. He sent me one, and it's at home somewhere. It didn't play on
my recorder and I didn't even try to play it since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you supply that to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you would make a note of that, I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Any particular speed that you want this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; and incidentally, if you would like it transcribed at a speed
that will play on your recorder, I am sure we would be happy to do that for
you, and just exchange tapes, since we are taking a tape from you, we will
give it back to you at a speed you can play.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Okay; all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, where did this KLIF interview take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. It was on the second floor there in the small room that was unoccupied
at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do after that interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I stayed around the office. I don't remember anything particularly
that I did do. Again, answering questions of people coming on. I think that
some men had been called in from off duty to report for duty. Gosh, I don't
even remember what time I got off from work that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you stay around the office all the rest of the time that you
were there, that you were on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, I would imagine that I went back to the basement. Let me
think. The rest of the time I didn't do anything in particular. I mean any
specific assignment that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you seem to have some idea that you went back to the
basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, the reason I think that I did, I had been away from there
about an hour and a half, and I just wanted to go back. I am sure that I went
back down there just to check on the situation and the confusion that might
have been in the basement, to see if possibly I would have to notify the on-coming
platoon how many men they might need to stay around the city hall, quell this
confusion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go back up to the third floor at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The rest of that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to any officers from the homicide bureau at all,
that day, the rest of that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Not that I recall; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with any police officers that day, about how Ruby
got into the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you talk to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; now, you are bringing something back. I know now
what I did immediately&mdash;we will have to go back on the record. When I got
back to the city hall, I contacted Lieutenant Pierce and advised him&mdash;that's
when I talked to Pierce about my conversation with Ruby, and I told him that
I had talked to Ruby and that he told me that&mdash;how he had gotten into the
basement, which was breaking security, and that Officer R.&nbsp;E. Vaughn was the
man involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Ruby told you&mdash;or you told <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I told Lieutenant Pierce that Ruby had told me he had came in
through the Main Street ramp, at which Officer Vaughn was posted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then what did you and Pierce do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. He notified the captain of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Talbert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did Talbert come in? Were you present when Pierce notified
Talbert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I was present when&mdash;I do know that they called Vaughn in, but
I think that he had already gone home that day, and that he was off the next
day, and I think they called him to tell him to come, to report to the office
this next morning, to investigate whether he did let Ruby in or how he got in,
or why he said he came in through his post.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn't talk with Vaughn the rest of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And to your knowledge Pierce didn't talk with him the rest of
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or Talbert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what else was done that day, as you recall, as a result of
your telling Pierce about the conversation with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I am sure that&mdash;I don't know. I am thinking that Captain Talbert
called Chief Fisher, notified him of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What's your best estimate of what time of the day that would
have been, that you talked with Pierce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. It was that afternoon, I believe, after I had gotten back from the
hospital. I didn't remember it a while ago, but I think when I did get back
from the hospital, that's when I told Lieutenant Pierce about it, somewhere
around 2:30 or 3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there any kind of record that you would have maintained,
or the police department would have maintained, that would give us some better
way of fixing that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dispatchers? Did you call the dispatcher to tell them you were
coming back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; now, it was about 2 when I was talking&mdash;or had taken Mrs.
Oswald in to view Lee, and I left then, somewhere around 2. So I got back
to the station, maybe around 2:25 or 2:30, so when I told Lieutenant Pierce
about it, it should have been somewhere around, maybe 3, or the first time I
saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you, after coming back and talking with Pierce, make
any further efforts or make any effort to talk with people who you had assigned
in the basement, or who you knew were working in the basement, concerning
the security of the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; I did ask Nelson could he say for sure that this man
didn't come through his post, and he said he could say for sure that he didn't
come through the police and court building, Nelson's post.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when did you talk with Nelson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. This was, I am sure, when I got back&mdash;probably when I got back
from the hospital. I don't recall. It might have been before I went. This was
my main thought, as to how the man got into the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you call Vaughn at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; I asked him, just as I asked the others, had this man
come through, because I knew the focal point was going to be on Vaughn, and
I knew the investigation was going to be on Vaughn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you talk with Vaughn that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. It seems that Lieutenant Pierce and I talked to him, and I think
Captain Talbert was there. It was up on the second floor. It seems that we
did talk to him that day, asked him did he have any knowledge of how he got
into the basement. Captain Talbert was doing most of the questioning. I told
Lieutenant Pierce and Captain Talbert what Ruby had told me, and from this
he was questioning Vaughn.</p>

<p>Now, I think this was in the afternoon and Vaughn was scheduled to be
off the next day, and Captain Talbert told him he better come on into work the
next day, for the purpose, I assumed, of more investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Nelson, when was Nelson talked to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well now. I talked to Nelson myself. I don't know. I am sure
that somebody else did too, but I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that before or after you talked with Vaughn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And where did that conversation with Nelson take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. He was still on his post when I talked to him. Of course, this&mdash;whether
it was before I went to the hospital or&mdash;I am sure that it probably was
before I went to the hospital, that I asked Nelson could he say for certain that
this man hadn't come by him, and he said yes. And then I asked Patterson,
all of them; Patterson, Nelson, Vaughn, stated the man did not come by their
post, but I&mdash;the focal would be on Vaughn, since I had been told that that's where
Ruby came in, by Ruby himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well now. Nelson gave a <span class="locked">statement&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice.</span> Excuse me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Nelson was interviewed by the Bureau&mdash;Federal Bureau of Investigation
on December 4, and the Bureau indicates that he told them, and this
is the Bureau's language and not his, talking about his post, he said the other
officer assigned there with him was a reserve officer whose name he does not
know. He was there for just 3 or 4 minutes, when Sergeant Putnam told them
to station themselves just behind the first jail office window, for people were
coming in, in regard to jail office business, such as seeing prisoners. They were
instructed not to let any unauthorized persons through the door or ramp leading
into the basement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
Okay, when I read that I was mistaken as to where I thought he was standing,
so that I was under the impression he was pulled off of his post, but that would be
entirely consistent. Apparently all they did was to move him a few feet.
Well, the jail office window, you have three here. One, two, and three windows&mdash;so
[indicating]. Well now, did you talk with Bobby Patterson at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; I asked him could he say for sure that this man didn't
come in his post.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And when did you talk with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Some time before I went to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with a reserve officer by the name of Newman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I don't recall the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with this reserve officer who was stationed over
in this area here, as you have indicated on the map [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I asked Sergeant Putnam&mdash;in fact, we had talked during the
day about this man, whether to keep him or not, and I said definitely keep him
there, tell him to remain there. Now, I don't recall talking to this man specifically
about seeing if anyone had come through here. I was fairly certain that they
hadn't. The main thing I was thinking about was that Ruby told me he came in
here. I had no reason to doubt him, but I didn't know how he had gotten in,
other than what he had said, just walking down, and I knew that this was
putting R.&nbsp;E. Vaughn in dereliction of his duty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now; it's my understanding you talked with Patterson
before you went to Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you talked with Vaughn and Nelson after you went to
Parkland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, I probably asked all of them the question, "Did you see this
man come in here; do you know him?" And, of course, Vaughn said he knew
him. Patterson said he knew him. I don't recall whether Nelson said he knew
him or not, but that Patterson and Vaughn both stated, and along with Nelson,
that he did not come through their post.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you talk with any of the other men who were stationed
down there in the basement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; these were the men that I assigned and gave my instructions,
and those were the ones that I could talk to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember, on November 24, talking at all with "Blackie"
Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about L.&nbsp;D. Miller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about McMillon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you saw McMillon and, as I <span class="locked">understand&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. He was with Jack Ruby when we interviewed him up in the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. And he asked no questions. I am sure that he stood there and
listened, as an interested party, <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Bob Lowery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; I didn't talk to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after you had passed this information on to Pierce, as I
recall, you said that you thought you might have talked with Vaughn some time
that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember anything else you did that afternoon besides
possibly talking with Vaughn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Not anything else particularly, other than asking Nelson and
Patterson, along with Vaughn, separately, rather, or individually, that I did ask
them did this man come by them, and they said no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. By the time you left work that day, had any instructions been
given with respect to preparing reports as to what happened?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; this was the next morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you file a report at the end of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. At the end of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you make any notes that particular day, on the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; my assignments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And other than your assignments, did you make any other notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you keep those in a regular assignment book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; just a small notebook that I had. I always&mdash;when I deal
with a group of men, rather than try to remember where I put them, I always
write it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was the first time that you made any notes about the
events, or wrote a report about the events of the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. November the&mdash;I think probably I wrote this report on the 25th,
which was the next day, but it's headed November the 26th, but I imagine that's
the time the typist got to it. She was doing a lot of typing from then on, but I
think the next morning is when I wrote this report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you have the original notes that you made, that you
used to write that report up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. This report; yes, sir. This is the one that I will supply to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Good. When was the next time that you saw Jack Ruby, after
your interview or session with him up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The next time I saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. In the courtroom during the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I am going to hand you what I have marked for identification
as Exhibit 5008, which is marked "Dallas, Texas, Sergeant Dean, March
25, 1964, Exhibit 5008." This is actually stapled to Exhibit 5007, but Exhibit
5008 is the report of the interview that you had with FBI Agents Paul L.
Scott and Edmond C. Hardin, on December 2, 1963, in Dallas. Will you look at
that, Sergeant Dean, and tell me if you had a chance to read that over? Let
me ask you first of all, if you have had a chance to read it over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; last night. There are some corrections [indicating]&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you state to us what you think should be corrected in that
statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. On page 1, the last paragraph, I don't know whether it's too
important. It says, "Dean recalled that before starting the search of the
basement he assigned Officer B.&nbsp;G. Patterson to stand at the Commerce Street
ramp leading to the basement." Now, this is actually the exit from the basement,
if that means anything. The way it reads here it sounds like that's the
entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't you take my pen and change that. You might make
it read, "which is the <span class="locked">exit"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Exit from the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; and if you would, just out in the margin, put your initials
and the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Page 2, paragraph 4, same error, Commerce Street ramp leading
into the basement [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I will mark it "exit". Page 4, paragraph 3&mdash;off the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; all right; that's all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. It says, "Dean has known Jack Ruby since 1959." This is
erroneous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How should it read?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. It should be either 1960 or 1961, whatever date&mdash;I could find out
and let you know for sure, the time that I came downtown from the Oak Cliff
area, as a sergeant. I was assigned to the downtown area, which includes the
location of Carousel Club. I have been downtown some 4 or 5 months before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
I was assigned to this location. So I would say it would have been about 4 or
5 months after I was transferred to the downtown area that I met Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long were you assigned to that downtown area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. About a year and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were you a sergeant at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any men working under your direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many men worked under your direction down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, it would vary from the hours that I worked, from 12 to 17
or 17 men, depending on the hours. Twelve regular men, or 13 regular men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was Vaughn under your direction at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir. Vaughn has never worked for me directly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Nelson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Bobby Patterson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir. Patterson worked for me when I was assigned to the area
in the 100, district 100, in the downtown area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And was that the area that Jack Ruby's nightclub was in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Patterson occasionally worked on the district that Ruby's Carousel
Club was on. Not as a regular man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know if Patterson was friendly with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You just don't know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you consider yourself a friend of Patterson's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Not intimately; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you see Patterson on a social basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does Patterson still work under your direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Whose direction is he under now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Sergeant Jennings, W.&nbsp;G. Jennings. He is still assigned to that
area. Not the specific district that the Carousel was on, or has been on, but
let's see&mdash;I don't recall exactly what district he is assigned to; 103 I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Go ahead, if there is anything else. Incidentally, on this date,
have we turned the page on that? The date there, why don't you make a
correction as to what you think it is, and if you feel, when you check your
notes, that you want to correct it even more exactly, why you can be free to do
it [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I would like to clarify this one thing. "On occasions when driving
in the area with another officer, he would go up to the Carousel, usually once or
twice a week." This is true, as far as once or twice a week, and sometimes three
times a week. However, this&mdash;with another officer is erroneous. Usually it
would be with some friend of mine that would be riding with me, rather than
another officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Why don't you put that down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Mutual friend <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This would be somebody that would be interested in sort of
riding with the police officer, like newspaper reporters do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir. "In addition, Dean said he had gone to the club while
off duty on four occasions." I would say four would be the outside, but I think I
have been there only three times since I have known him, since 1960 or 1961
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don't you change that, then. When is the time you were
there most recently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The last time I had been in his place was&mdash;well, we will say
relative to the shooting, I haven't been in there since, and I think 6 or 8 months
before would be the last time I had been in there, and in fact, that long since
I had seen Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know any of Ruby's employees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. By name. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you knew them to talk to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. To speak only. The people that were in the trial, well, George
Senator, I didn't know his name. I couldn't place it&mdash;knew the face but I
didn't know his name until the trial, and he was a bartender regularly at the
club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was he the bartender there on a regular basis in 1960 or
1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir. He was a regular there all the time that I worked there,
or worked in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who else did you recognize at the trial whom you remember
from the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I don't believe I recognized anyone, other than this fellow George
Senator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there a Negro man named Andy Armstrong that testified
at the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I don't know. I don't know Andy Armstrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He is one of Ruby's workers there.</p>

<p>Okay. Anything else in there that [indicating]&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, I would like for the record to show that my visits while off
duty to the Carousel was definitely an exception rather than rule, and it would
usually be when out-of-town people would come to town, and this, by my working
in that area, had gone in there frequently on duty, I knew&mdash;or there had never
been any trouble in there, to my knowledge, as far as fights and such as that.
I knew it was a safe place for an off-duty officer to go, and interesting to someone
that hadn't seen it. So this is the exception that I went there. I recall
now, by reading this investigation by the FBI, that soon after I had left the
basement after this shooting, or left the immediate area where Oswald was
laying, I do recall now asking R.&nbsp;C. Nelson, that was stationed at that doorway,
had he come in that way, and he then stated he was positive he hadn't. This
was reflected in this&mdash;I do remember. I wanted it to show that I do remember
now, after reading that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, let me stop you here, Sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me direct your attention to one portion of that report. Have
you read that portion of the report which deals with this lengthy discussion
that you and I had about the talk, the one talk you had with Ruby on the date
that Ruby shot Oswald; have you read that portion of the report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. In the FBI report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Let's see. I don't recall reading it. You mean now have I read
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Have you just read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No; I haven't read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you find that, or I can maybe find it for you quicker, but
would you find that portion in there and would you read that and tell me if that
reports everything that you learned from Ruby at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. If it's included in this report [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. And I don't have simply reference to the discussion about
entering the basement, but if it reports everything of importance that he told
you during that interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I believe that this February 18 report would&mdash;the FBI report
doesn't include&mdash;it has the questions that I asked of Ruby and not of Sorrels,
if that's what you mean, it does. But this February 18 report is what [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me hand you, then, what I have marked for identification as
Exhibit 5010. It's a copy of a letter signed by you, dated February 18, 1964,
addressed to Mr. J.&nbsp;E. Curry, chief of police. Did you prepare that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes; I did [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And let me ask you this, is that a true and accurate copy of the
actual original letter that you sent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That's a copy I made myself, a Xerox copy [indicating].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you write that letter on the basis of any notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; from memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you prepare any prior reports to the police department
or anybody else, in connection with the events that are recounted in that February
18th letter, other than the letter dated November 26, to Chief Curry, which
I have marked Exhibit 5009, and this interview report, which we have designated
5008; are there any other writings that you prepared prior to February
18?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; there is one report that I had written regarding the
article in the newspaper, that I had seen Ruby come into the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Do you have that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don't know if I have got that or not. Could you get us a copy
of that? I don't know if we have that or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; now, I think the FBI made several&mdash;or made a report
of that, also. The investigation about the department there, I don't <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, I know they made an investigation of it, and I don't have
the actual copy of the report. I have got the results of their investigation but
not the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Other than that report on the newspaper article and
these two other exhibits that I have referred to, are there any other writings
that you made that relate to the subject matters as recounted in this February
<span class="locked">18&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Letter. Now, how did you come to write this letter of February
18, 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Chief Stevenson called me, while I was in the office on that date,
and asked me to come up to see him, and I did. And he asked me was I present
during the entire interview with Ruby and Mr. Sorrels. I told him I was. And
he asked me did I remember most of the interview; could I recollect most of
the interview and the answers that Ruby had given and I said, "Yes, sir." Then
he advised me to make a report of it, asked me would I make a report of it,
recalling everything that I could of that interview. To the best of my knowledge,
that's all I could remember. And I did testify to all this stuff in the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this the first time that you told anyone that Ruby had told
Sorrels that he thought about killing Oswald two nights prior when he saw him
in the showup room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, I don't recall telling it to any particular person. I knew
that this would probably be later used as testimony, I felt, since it was&mdash;did
make an impression on me, that I could remember it, and it's written as I do
remember, just about as it happened, it correlates pretty well, even though we
didn't get together with Mr. Sorrels' report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you can't remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Talking to anyone especially or specifically about what Ruby had
told me, other than how he got into the basement and how long he had been
there; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or of any particular reference to the statement that Ruby made
to Sorrels that you have reported in here, about thinking about killing Oswald
two nights before; you can't remember that you <span class="locked">ever&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; I did feel at the time that I would probably testify to this
in court. I did witness Mr. Sorrels taking his notes, and I felt if I had to,
since I did witness it, I could use the notes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I think there is one other exhibit that I haven't identified.
We have talked about it, and that's Exhibit 5009, which is a copy of a letter
which purports to have been prepared by you, addressed to Chief Curry, dated
November 26, 1963.</p>

<p>Would you look at Exhibit 5009 [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; that's my report [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you have read that over many times, have you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; would you like for me to sign it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, sir; I would like for you to sign both 5008 and 5009.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any additions or corrections you wanted to make to
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Put a date by that, by your signature also, if you will [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And let me hand you 5010, and ask you to sign that and date
it [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. It's been signed&mdash;of course, this is a Xerox copy. Do you want me
to go ahead and sign it again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you take this one here, Exhibit 5008, and would you
sign that and date it [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Where [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the front page, I think probably is just as well [indicating].
Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sergeant, you and I have been talking here off the record for&mdash;I
don't have a watch, but I would guess for 15 or 20 minutes, with respect to
other matters, and you indicated to me just before we brought the court reporter
in, that you had obtained some information that apparently had not been
previously made available to the Commission, and I wonder if you could tell
us what that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. It was relative to a telephone call that I received last night at
about 2 o'clock in the morning. I didn't mark the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. At city hall. In the office there. The city hall operator had
called me and told me that she had a man, or an operator on the line from
Victoria, British Columbia, in Canada, and that she had been&mdash;this operator
had told her she had been talking to a man in Victoria about some films that
he had of the assassination, and asked me did I want to take the call, and it
wasn't&mdash;it was a collect call, and the operator said that she couldn't unless it
was by my authorization, but she did tell me she heard this man talk enough
that she believed he was serious and had something that possibly could be used
by the Warren Commission. And, of course, I heard some of the conversation,
and the man sounded rational, and the operator in Victoria, her name was
Bernice Williamson, she is the night supervisor of the B.C. Telephone Company,
said that she had talked to this man long enough that she thought he probably
had something. And so I accepted the call. This man's name was Ralph
Simpson. He was calling from 384-3780, and he told me that he had been standing
on the southern part of the plaza when the assassination took place, and
he had a wide scope movie camera that he believed would have taken in the
building and the motorcade at the time the shots were fired; that he had talked
it over with his attorney&mdash;and the name of the attorney was Batter [spelling]
B-a-t-t-e-r, is what I got, and that Batter advised him to call someone here,
but not the Warren Commission. And he asked me&mdash;when I accepted the
call, he asked me what I would suggest, and I told him that first he should
mail them to the Warren Commission. And then he asked me had I been to
the Warren Commission. He recognized my name, that I had been testifying,
and I said, "Yes; and I am scheduled to go back tomorrow night." And he
said, "Well, I will send the films to you. They haven't been&mdash;". Well, he said
they hadn't been developed, and he wasn't going to have them developed, that
he would send them to me airmail. This was about 2 o'clock in the night&mdash;on
the morning of the 24th, this morning [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. You have in front of you, Sergeant, a piece of paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; what I took <span class="locked">notes&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are those your original notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can I mark that for identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to mark this, "Dallas. Tex., Sergeant Dean, March 24,
1964, Exhibit 5012." Now, let me see if I understand you correctly. This was
a collect call placed from Canada to the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. By a man by the name of Simpson, Ralph Simpson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you actually talk with Simpson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did the telephone call last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Four minutes and three seconds, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this the name of the operator that put the call through,
Bernice Williamson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. She was the Victoria operator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you get the name of the city operator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The city operator was Patsy. I don't know her last name.
Patsy. She is the night operator at city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you indicate that Patsy handled that? Did Patsy listen
in on the call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And have you talked with her about this since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; she called back and gave me the time and charges on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And is there a record of that in the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you get that for us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I would appreciate that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Now, when she called me back to give me the time and charges
she said that the operator had further checked this number 384-3780, and
that number was&mdash;the call was made from the residence of the initials R.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;W.,
last name [spelling] S-m-e-l-e [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who had checked that, now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The police <span class="locked">department&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Patsy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; this night supervisor, Bernice Williamson in Canada,
had contacted the police department there and asked them could they cross
that number, or furnish her the address or name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Bernice Williamson tell you this after you finished the
telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. She told Patsy, the city hall operator this, and this <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Patsy reconveyed that to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you learned this from Patsy after the conversation with
Simpson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; this R.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;W. Smele has an address of 1141 Caldonia
in Victoria.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Have you reported this to anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I appreciate your bringing it to us then, very much.</p>

<p>Would you sign that exhibit, Sergeant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We will certainly look into that right away.</p>

<p>Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Sergeant, we have been off the record here awhile,
and you indicated that the man said something about having been here on
vacation and some other thing. Will you tell us what else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. He said he had been here on vacation and that when he learned
of the President's coming, he had stationed himself on the southwestern part
of the plaza, toward the railroad tracks, and that he had a wide scope&mdash;he referred
to it as a full wide scope camera, and that he believed that he had gotten
the assassination. He was taking pictures at the time of the assassination, and
he believed that he had the building in the background, because it's in direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
trajectory of the line of fire. My impression of him was that since he said that
he had talked it over with his attorney and didn't know what to do with these
things, that he seemed to be scared as to whether to keep them or throw them
away or what. When he told me that he would send them to me, that he said,
"You can have them. I haven't developed them, and you don't have to send me
any copies of them back."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you notify us as soon as they receive those films?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And turn them over to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir. You want all the records from the city hall operator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Telephone call; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. This has been signed and dated [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Now, I don't know if you have had a chance to read
this or not, but this is what I have marked as Exhibit 5011, which is an interview
with you by Special Agent Paul Scott of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
on December 9, 1963. Would you look that over and <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Sign it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sign it and make any changes or additions that you want to
make in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. [Indicating.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then let me state for the record that I appreciate very much
the assistance that Sergeant Dean has given us here this evening, and I hope,
and I am sure that if anything further comes to light which he thinks would
be of value to the Commission, that he will come forward with it voluntarily,
as you have here today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Burt, this&mdash;of course, I was cleared of all of this, as far as this
newspaper <span class="locked">article&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I was just wondering if you had the FBI report on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We do. And I just wanted to make sure that as far as any
statements are concerned, that you have made, or report, that you had a
chance to look at them, and to my knowledge, I think I have shown you every
one that we have on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. That's all.</p>

<h2 id="PTDR">TESTIMONY OF PATRICK TREVORE DEAN RESUMED</h2>

<p>The testimony of Patrick Trevore Dean was taken at 4:45 p.m., on April 1,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of
the President's Commission. Mr. P.&nbsp;T. Dean was accompanied by his lawyer,
Mr. Ted MacMasters.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Note that I am present. Note that Sgt. P.&nbsp;T. Dean is present
and Mr. Ted MacMasters assistant city attorney of Dallas, and appearing as
attorney for Mister&mdash;Sergeant Dean. Now, Sergeant Dean, your deposition was
begun <span class="locked">on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I believe it was a Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMasters</span>. March 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Burt Griffin as the member of the Commission's advisory
staff conducting the examination. At that time you took an oath, I believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you willing to consider that this is simply a continuation
of that deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that you are under the same oath that you were before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wish to advise you that I have been authorized by Mr. J. Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
Rankin, general counsel for the Commission's staff to take your deposition under
oath also. In other words, both Mr. Griffin and I have been so authorized,
and I think he advised you of the general conditions and the right of notice and
waiver and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that as far as I am concerned, I will just ask you if you have
anything to add to your deposition or anything to say at all in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I told Mr. Griffin on that date that I would bring him additional
information that he wanted.</p>

<p>One was a record of the telephone call received on the 24th. Now, that
would make your interview on the 25th, actually, I believe. Now, no, no; that's
right. The morning, early morning hours of the 24th is when I received this
call from Victoria, Canada.</p>

<p>That is a record of it from the city hall operator. That was pertaining to
the film from the fellow in Alaska&mdash;or&mdash;correction, in Canada that he said he
<span class="locked">would&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMasters</span>. Do you want to identify this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have handed me two documents and I judge that one of
them is a photostatic copy of a front of a document, and the other is a photostatic
copy of the rear of that document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well; I am going to mark them for identification as follows:
"Dallas, Tex., April 1, 1964. Exhibit&mdash;" We'll use number&mdash;5136, continuation
of deposition of Sgt. P.&nbsp;T. Dean." And I am signing my name for the purposes
of identification and I am signing the second document which you state is a
photostatic copy of the back of the document now identified as Exhibit 5136, as
follows: "Dallas, Tex., April 1, 1964. Exhibit 5136-A, continuation of Deposition
of P.&nbsp;T. Dean." Signing my name on the back of this, and for the purposes
of identification and to show that we are both talking about the same document,
would you mind putting your name below mine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, will you identify what these two documents were? Perhaps
we'd better do it again, in the light of their identification numbers, so,
let me ask you what are the documents that have now been marked for identification
as 5136 and 5136-A?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. A record of the city hall's operator receiving a call from Victoria,
Canada, on that date of March 24, about 4 o'clock in the morning and at that
time I talked to&mdash;I believe it is Jack Simpson, or it is Ralph Simpson, and he
stated that he had a reel of movie film that he had taken of the assassination
and the trajectory of the line of fire which was on the far side of the plaza, which
would be on the south side of Commerce Street. Mr. Simpson told me on the
phone that he believed he had gotten not only the assassination, but also the
building from where the bullet was fired. But I advised him&mdash;he wanted to
know what to do with this film, and I advised him to send it to the Warren
Commission in Washington, and he said that he had talked to his attorney and
the attorney, Batter [phonetic] in Victoria, I didn't get the first name, his attorney
had advised him to contact someone in Dallas and to send them to whatever
place they said other than to the Warren Commission. He then asked me
could he send them to me and I told him that he could. I checked with my office
then just before coming over here today and the film hadn't come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say he was going to send them by mail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes; he said he would airmail them the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he indicate why he had called you, or just that you were on
duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Just on the advice of his attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, I mean, your particular name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No; he didn't ask for me particularly. However, he said that he
recognized my name from reading of my testimony in the papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, he made the call, he was calling specifically to
you. You happened to be on duty, and therefore, the call came to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That's right, and that is the record of the call received. That is
what Mr. Griffin wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the other part that you told us about was the substance of
a phone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right. Okay. Now, if you are going to talk about another
document let's get it identified first and get numbers on it. Now. Mr. Dean, you
are handing me a document consisting of three pages being apparently a photostatic
copy of a letter dated April 8, 1963, addressed to J.&nbsp;E. Curry, Chief of
Police. Last page shows "P. Treavor <span class="locked">Dean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMasters</span>. I believe that is December 8. You said April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, no, no. December 8. Couldn't be April 8, we aren't there
yet.</p>

<p>"P. Treavor Dean, Sergeant Police Control Division," and in order that it may
be identified and that the record may show what we're talking about, I am
marking this first page in the right-hand margin, "Dallas, Tex., April 1, 1964.
Exhibit 5137, Continuation of Deposition of P.&nbsp;T. Dean," signing my name below
that, and the inscription on the second page, placing my initial in the right-hand
lower corner and on the third page I am doing the same, and also ask you
to sign the pages and initial them as I have done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Now, do you have any comments to make with
reference to this Document 5137, which you have handed me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; I believe it is self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is this one of the documents <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Mr. Griffin asked me would I bring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Mr. Griffin also asked me to bring a copy, if I had one, of my
original notes that I had taken in the basement that day of my assignments
and I have those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what day are you speaking of? The 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; November 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. November 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. They are not all&mdash;all my assignments are not here. However,
the majority of them are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say your assignments, you mean the people you assigned,
or the job you were assigned to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. The people that I assigned to various locations in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. Now, do you propose to let me then have that or a photostatic
copy of it, or do you propose simply to dictate the information into the
record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, how about me just dictating it and I will keep this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, if Mr. Griffin's purpose was to find out whether
they existed, then perhaps I ought to look at them so I can state I have seen
these things myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, let the record show that as Mr. Dean reads the
information he is going to read, I am following him, and if he reads them
correctly, I will say nothing. If he reads them incorrectly, or in a way that
I do not understand, I will call it to his attention so that we may get it clear.</p>

<p>All right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. My first assignments were made just prior to our searching the
basement. They were Officer Vaughn. R.&nbsp;E. Vaughn I assigned to the Main
Street ramp, which is the north ramp entering the basement. Officer Patterson,
B.&nbsp;G. Patterson to the Commerce Street ramp, which is the exit onto Commerce
Street. These men were to be&mdash;were assigned to the top of these ramps.
Officer Brock was assigned to the elevator in the basement. Officer Nelson
was assigned in the hall at the jail doors. Well, in&mdash;at the jail window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. This is "Commerce ramp".</p>

<p>All right, now, Officer Jez, I assigned him with Patterson at the Commerce
Street ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, of course, these notes are not exactly like that. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
have added a few words, but let the record show that there is&mdash;displayed to
me a paper which has, in substance, all that Mr. Dean has testified to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMasters</span>. You are interpolating your notes, aren't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir; and adding initials and&mdash;yes, sir. These two other men
here, I don't know which one for sure, but they are Reserve Officers Fred A.
Briederdorf, it looks like [spelling] B-r-i-e-d-e-r&mdash;or, B-e-r-d-r-f, and also another
man by the name of Hunt, initials of which I don't know, or the first
name.</p>

<p>They were assigned to the basement, and I think that one of these two men
I assigned to the entrance into the basement, or the machinery room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is a word here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Reserve.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, that is <span class="locked">reserve&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. This is the page where I started to make some traffic assignments
and they changed it, so, I&mdash;now, these are the traffic assignments just
prior to the movement of Oswald. At Commerce and Pearl I assigned Officer
Erwin, initials I don't know. At Commerce and Central, Officer Burton. At
Central and Main, Officer Wages. At Central and Elm, Officer Gregory. At
Pearl and Elm, Officer Tolbert. At Harwood and Elm, Officer Fox. At St. Paul
and Elm, Officer Wise. At Elm and Ervay, shows here Brock. Brock. At
Stone and Elm, Officer Raz. Akard and Elm, Officer Hibbs. At Field and Elm,
Officer Anderson, and at Lamar and Elm, Officer Ferris. Now, these were
just tentative assignments. I think in one of my reports that is already in
evidence is the permanent assignments, but these are the originals that I made
that afternoon which were tentative.</p>

<p>Now, this is just a note that I had written down from a Bob Stewart. He
worked for WRR, and he was giving me some information that he had received.
I don't remember from where he had received it, but he stated to me,
and I had written it down here, a Serge Fliger, he is with Mutual News in
Vienna, Austria, and that in essence&mdash;now, I can interpret these notes for
you, if you would rather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why don't you just read them and then interpret them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That source of Serge's information from behind the Iron Curtain
that a man told him, and he&mdash;it was a man that he stated that he trusted completely,
that there was a group of dissident Russian soldiers, that this whole
thing was an international plot, and that the Communists would kill off Oswald
as quick as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, with reference to those last few notes about Fliger, what
you have read is not exactly what is in the book itself, but it is rather <span class="locked">your&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. More of an interpretation of my notes, because I had written
it rather hurriedly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, let the record show that as I read the notes the interpretation
of them seems consistent with what I read.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. I believe that is all that is in here, Mr. Hubert. I believe that's
all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, may I ask this; were all those notes that you have just
shown to me and read into the record with interpolations written in your
own hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were they written at the time that you made the various assignments
and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that includes also that information about that Serge Fliger
from Austria?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. And also, Mr. Griffin wanted me to find, if I could obtain a
copy of the&mdash;regarding a tape recording. It was an interview with radio
station KLIF, and this interview took place about 2:30 on November 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 2:30 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. That afternoon. Yes, sir; I do have a copy of that and I have
listened to it and it is true and correct to the best of my knowledge, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you proposing to give me the tape itself, or a transcription
of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, that is a transcript, I assume. I just asked KLIF would
they make me a copy of it and this is, a transcript.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you propose to let me have the film, or this little record,
or seems to be tape on a regular roll. Do you want it back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Could I have it back when the Commission gets through with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, sir; but I don't know when that will be, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Well, whenever it might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am trying to see how we are going to mark this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">MacMasters</span>. Could it be placed in a sealed envelope and initialed across
it and seal it and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I have placed my initials, LDH, on one end of the tape, and
I have done that also, on the other end of the tape and giving the exhibit
number of&mdash;by marking it "EX, 5138," with ball point pen on both ends of the
tape, and then I'm also marking the small box, "5138" on one side, and
"5138" on the other side, with my initials on both sides.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Do you want me to initial it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, I don't know that that is necessary if you have heard that
recording.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it is a true recording of an interview of you, as I understand
it, that you had with some reporter of <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. At KLIF.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Glenn Duncan. It is on the tape also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. You think it is a correct recording of a conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir; I, well, when these film, if they do come in, this fellow
does send them to me, I will make them available to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You can do so through Mr. Barefoot Sanders. Contact us
immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I will accept this and place these various exhibits you have
given me today in with the other exhibits in the folder that we are putting
all these exhibits in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any other matters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dean</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is all. Thank you very much. Mr. MacMasters, thank
you very much.</p>

<h2>Transcriber's Notes</h2>

<p>Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Misspellings in quoted evidence not changed; misspellings that could be
due to mispronunciations were not changed.</p>

<p>Some simple typographical errors were corrected.</p>

<p>Inconsistent hyphenation of compound words retained.</p>

<p>Ambiguous end-of-line hyphens retained.</p>

<p>Occasional uses of "Mr." for "Mrs." and of "Mrs." for "Mr." corrected.</p>

<p>Dubious repeated words, (e.g., "the nature of the inquiry tonight is to
to determine the facts") retained.</p>

<p>Several unbalanced quotation marks not remedied.</p>

<p>Occasional periods that should be question marks not changed.</p>

<p>Occasional periods that should be commas, and commas that should be
periods, were changed only when they clearly had been misprinted (at
the end of a paragraph or following a speaker's name in small-caps at
the beginning of a line). Some commas and semi-colons were printed so
faintly that they appear to be periods or colons: some were found and
corrected, but some almost certainly remain.</p>

<p>Occasional missing periods at the ends of sentences have been remedied.</p>
